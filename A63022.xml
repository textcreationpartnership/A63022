         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE whole Reign of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was ſuch a Series of admirable Events, ſuch a Pattern of wiſe and honeſt Counſel and ſteady Conduct (ſuch an age of helliſh Plots and ſecret Conſpiracies by the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) on the one hand; and ſuch prudent Circumſpection, Female Courage and Zeal (and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Deliverances) on the other; that no Hiſtory can deſerve to be more minutely deſcribed than the Affairs in her time: And though many famous Pens have already travelled therein, and given us a fair proſpect of her actions, the ſubtile Contrivances and open Force of her Enemies againſt her ſacred Life, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and the many providences and more than humane ſucceſs which bleſſed and crowned her days; yet we never had ſo full an account of her laſt Parliaments as is comprehended in this Volume, eſpecially ſo curiouſly as the very laſt is, collected by Mr. <hi>Townſhend</hi> a worthy Member in that Seſsion, who hath ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done it, that it is thought very fit, even after ſo long an Interval, to appear in publick. There have been many excellent perſons of the greateſt abilities and worth, who though they had not the ambition to
<pb facs="tcp:107812:3"/>ſtruggle to be choſen into the Houſe, and were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted without-doors with all the moſt important paſſages within, have yet often wiſhed they might have had the liberty of ſitting there but a few days, onely to obſerve the behaviour, methods, and tempers of Men ſo aſſembled, and be an eye-witneſs how things are managed and paſſed there. Now in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation there is ſo particular and exquiſite an Account, that ſuch may even ſatisfie their curioſity in thoſe very Circumſtances: For this is not onely the Journal-Book of what is entered upon Record, but (in the laſt Seſsion eſpecially) there are all the particular Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Motions, Arguments, nay and the very beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of every one in that grand Aſſembly; and all ſo painted to the life, that to a conſidering Reader, it is almoſt the ſame thing as if he had been preſent with them all the while. Here you will finde that the Grievances they laboured to have redreſſed, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable, their Arguments rational and ſtrong, though finely adorned; which will be eaſily believed, when we know the famous Secretary <hi>Cecill,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> and many other ſolid States-men, were fellow-Members in this illuſtrious Aſſembly, whoſe Speeches alone are, as I ſhould gueſs, a ſufficient Invitation to any one that has but heard of them in our Engliſh world, to know how they behaved themſelves in that Houſe of Commons: which that you may do, I ſhall make no further Preamble, but conduct you into the Work it ſelf.</p>

               <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> That here one of the Judges is particularly nominated to attend upon the Lords Committees; which may further prove, that in all the former places where the Judges or the Queens learned Counſel are named as Committees, it is no errour or miſtake of the Clerk. So that hence the difference may very well be gathered to be this: That where a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Lords was formerly uſed to be ſelected out to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107812:7"/>meet with another Committee of the Houſe of Commons, here neither the Judges being but Aſſiſtants, nor the Queens learned Counſel being but Attendants of and upon the Houſe, were ever nominated or appointed as joynt Committees with the Lords, becauſe the very Members of either Houſe onely are then admitted to partake of ſuch matters of weight and ſecrecy as they do there commonly confer upon. But when the Lords, amongſt themſelves, do appoint a Committee to conſider of ſome ordinary Bill that is to paſs their Houſe, and eſpecially if the Bill do concern matter of Law, here it hath been anciently uſed, and may ſtill, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the honour of that Houſe, be continued, that the Kings learned Counſel, but eſpecially the Judges, may be nominated as Committees alone, or as joynt Committees with the Lords: for in regard that nothing can be abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at a Committee, but all matters ſhall ſtill depend on the reſolution of the Houſe; and ſo no inconvenience ſhall enſue thereupon.</p>
            <p>After the Committees of both Houſes had met, the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees proceeded to the amendments of the Bill; and afterwards this preſent day the Bill and Amendments received their ſecond reading and paſſed the Houſe, and were ſent down to the Houſe of Commons to be amended by them, by Doctor <hi>Carewe</hi> and Maſter Solicitor.</p>
            <p>It appeareth by the Journal-book, that the Houſe of Commons having yielded to a Conference, did preſently chuſe Committees, and ſent them up to the Upper Houſe.</p>

                     <p>In the times of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> a Parliament was held by the Noble Queen <hi>Ina,</hi> by theſe words: I <hi>Ina</hi> Queen of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>If I may be bold to ſay it, I muſt preſume to ſay that which hath been often ſaid; but what is well ſaid, cannot be too often ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: This ſweet Council of ours I would compare to that ſweet Commonwealth of the little Bees;</hi>

                     <p>The little Bees have but one Governour, whom they all ſerve; he is their King, <hi>Quia latrea habet latiora;</hi> he is placed in the midſt of their habitations, <hi>ut in tutiſſima turri:</hi> they forage abroad, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king honey from every flower, to bring to their King: <hi>Ignavum Fucos pecus à Principibus arcent,</hi> the Drones they drive out of their Hives, <hi>non habentes aculeos;</hi> and whoſo aſſails their King, in him <hi>immittunt aculeos, &amp; tamen Rex ipſe eſt ſine aculeo.</hi>

                     <p>Your Majeſty is that Princely Governour and Noble Queen, whom we all ſerve; being protected under the ſhadow of your wings, we live; and wiſh you may ever ſit upon your Throne over us; and whoſoever ſhall not ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> for them we pray, <hi>ut convertantur nè pereant, &amp; ut confundantur nè noceant.</hi>

I come now to your Laws.</p>
                     <p>The Laws we have conferred upon this Seſſion of ſo honourable a Parliament, are of two natures; the one ſuch as have life, but are ready to die, except your Majeſty breathe life into them again; the other are Laws that never had life, but being void of life, do come to your Majeſty to ſeek life.</p>
                     <p>The first ſort are thoſe Laws that had continuance until this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and are now to receive new life, or are to die for ever. The other that I term capable of life, are thoſe which are newly made, but have no eſſence until your Majeſty giveth them life.</p>
                     <p>Two Laws there are, but I must give the honour where it is due, for they come from the noble wiſe Lords of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Houſe, the most honourable and beneficial Laws that could be deſired; the one a Confirmation of all Letters-Patents from your Majeſties most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Father of all Eccleſiaſtical Livings which that King of most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Memory took from thoſe ſuperſtitious Monaſteries and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories, and tranſlated them to the erecting of many foundations of Cathedral Churches and Colledges, thereby greatly furthering the maintenance of Learning and true Religion. The other Law to ſuppreſs the obſtinant Recuſate, and the dangerous Sectary; both very pernicious to your Royal Government.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, your most loving and obedient Subjects, the Commons of the Lower Houſe, most humbly and with dutiful thanks ſtand bound unto your gracious goodneſs for your general and large Pardon gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, wherein many great Offences are pardoned; but it extendeth onely to Offences done before the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>I have many ways, ſince the beginning of this Parliament, by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and inſufficiency to perform that which I ſhould have done, offended your Majeſty; I most humbly crave to be partaker of your most gracious Pardon.</p>

                     <p>She miſliked alſo, that ſuch irreverence was ſhewed towards Privy-Counſellors, (who were not to be accounted as common Knights and Burgeſſes of the Houſe,<note place="margin">Gently rebukes them for ſome Miſcarriages.</note> that are Counſellors but during the Parliament;) whereas the other are ſtanding Counſellors, and for their wiſdom and great ſervice, are called to the Council of State.</p>
                     <p>Then he ſaid, That the Queens Majeſty had heard that ſome men, in the caſe of great neceſſity and grant of Aid, had ſeemed to regard their Country, and made their neceſſity more than it was, forgetting the urgent neceſſity of the time, and dangers that were now eminent.</p>
                     <p>That her Majeſty would not have the People feared with Reports of great dangers,<note place="margin">Gives them Cautions.</note> but rather to be encouraged with boldneſs againſt the Enemies of the State.

                     <head>The Lord Keeper's Speech being ended, after ſome time of intermiſſion, the Queen being ſat in her Chair of State, uſed a Princely Speech unto the Houſes; of which, the greateſt part was to the effect and purpoſe following.</head>
                     <p>THis Kingdom hath had many wiſe,<note place="margin">The Qu. ſpeaks her ſelf.</note> noble, and victorious Princes; I will not compare with any of them in Wiſdom, Fortitude, or any other Vertues: but ſaving the duty of a Childe, that is not to compare with his Father, in Love, Care, Sincerity, and Juſtice, I will compare with any Prince that ever you had or ſhall have.</p>
                     <p>It may be thought ſimplicity in me, that all this time of my Reign I have not ſought to advance my Territories, and enlarge my Dominions; for opportunity hath ſerved me to do it. I acknowledge my womanhood and weakneſs in that reſpect; but though it hath been not hard to obtain, yet I doubted how to keep the things ſo obtained: that hath onely held me from ſuch attempts. And I muſt ſay, my minde was never to invade my Neighbours, or to uſurp over any; I am contented to reign over mine own, and to rule as a just Prince.</p>
                     <p>Yet the King of <hi>Spain</hi> doth challenge me to be the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reller, and the beginner of all theſe Wars; in which he doth me the greateſt wrong that can be: for my Conſcience doth not accuſe my thoughts wherein I have done him the least injury; but I am perſwaded in my Conſcience, if he knew what I know, he himſelf would be ſorry for the wrong that he hath done me.</p>
                     <p>I fear not all his Threatnings; his great Preparations and mighty Forces do not ſtir me: for though he come againſt me with a greater power than ever was his <hi>Invincible</hi> Navy, I doubt not (God aſſiſting me, upon whom I always trust) but that I ſhall be able to defeat and overthrow him. I have great advantage against him; for my Cauſe is just.</p>
                     <p>I heard ſay, when he attempted his last Invaſion, ſome upon the Sea-coast forſook their Towns, and flew up higher into the Country, and left all naked and expoſed to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. But I ſwear unto you by God,<note place="margin">The Q. ſwears by God, the will puniſh Cowards.</note> if I knew thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or of any that ſhall do ſo hereafter, I will make them know and feel, what it is to be ſo fearful in ſo urgent a Cauſe.</p>

But let me tell you, that the ſum is not ſo much, but that it is needful for a Prince to have ſo much always lying in her Coffers, for your defence in time of need, and not to be driven to get it when we ſhould uſe it.</p>
                     <p>You that be Lieutenants and Gentlemen of Command in your Countries, I require you to take care that the People be well armed, and in readineſs upon all occaſions. You that be Judges and Juſtices of the Peace, I command and ſtraightly charge you, that you ſee the Laws to be duely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and that you make them living Laws, when we have put life into them.</p>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Robert Cecill.</speaker>
               <p>AS I remember,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cecill</hi>'s Speech.</note> I have been of this Houſe theſe five Parliaments, and I have not determined to ſay any thing in theſe Aſſemblies further than my Cogitations ſhould concur with my Conſcience, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare I and No. Give me leave, I pray you, to rehearſe an old Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is in Latine: <hi>Nec te Collaudes, nec te Vituperes ipſe:</hi> For me to do the one, were exceeding Arrogancy; and to do the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I confeſs, I hope you will pardon me.</p>
               <p>The occaſion of this Parliament, which I take to be by that which we received from the honourable and learned Speech of the Lord Keeper, as of and from her Majeſty to us, in the Higher Houſe, is for the cauſe of Religion, and the maintenance thereof amongst us; the preſervation of her Majeſties most Royal Perſon, and the good of this Realm our Country.</p>
               <p>All which, becauſe they be things of most dear and nearest price, and at this preſent in exceeding great and eminent danger, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveful to conſult of moſt ſpeedy remedies, which in parcels ſhould proceed from the moſt wiſe heads.</p>
               <p>The Enemy to theſe, is the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe malice and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is ſuch, that together with the Pope, that Antichriſt of <hi>Rome;</hi> for I may well couple them together, the one being always accompanied with Envy and Proſperity, the other with unſatiable deſire, makes them by all means ſeek the ſubverſion of this State.</p>
               <p>But concerning the firſt, the Cauſe of God and his Religion, which her Majeſty profeſſed before ſhe came on this Royal Seat, which ſhe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107812:31"/>hath defended and maintained, and for which cauſe God hath ſo bleſſed her Government ever ſince her coming to the Crown: yea, while the Crown was ſcarce warm on her head, ſhe aboliſhed the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did ſet up God's Truth amongst us, and, to her great Renown, made this little Land to be a Sanctuary for all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Saints of God; whereby the People perceived her Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Zeal, and Judgment.</p>
               <p>Magnanimity, in underſtanding ſo great an Enterprize; Zeal, in profeſſing the ſame, not of ſhew, but in ſincerity; Judgment, in defending it, and preventing all the Popes deſignes: He ſet forth his Bulls and Miſſives against her Majeſty, thereby most unnaturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving her of her most natural Right, Duty, and Loyalty, which her Subjects ſhould owe unto her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here he touched the many dangers which her Majeſty had been in; which, as it cauſed him to fear to think, ſo it did cauſe him to tremble to ſpeak, concerning the danger of our Country; and ſo the loſs of our Lives, Liberties, Wives, Children, and all other Priviledges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me not trouble you with things paſſed ſo long, and perhaps beyond my reach; but of things paſſed of late years, and ſince <hi>88:</hi> when as we were ſo ſecure, and never thought the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would have ſet up his Reſt for <hi>England,</hi> then ſent he his Navy, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Invincible,</hi> and had almost been upon the backs of us, before we were aware; yea, we were ſo ſlack in Proviſion, that it was too late to make reſiſtance, had not God preſerved us; his attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, by ſeeking to win the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and to obtain <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which being but trifles, and partly devices, (which I mean not to trouble you with.) He hath now of late gone about to win <hi>France,</hi> wherein he hath greatly prevailed, as in <hi>Lorain</hi> and in other parts, as you have heard; but eſpecially in <hi>Britain,</hi> having moſt part of the Port-towns in his poſſeſſion; whither he ſtill ſends Supplies dayly, and re-enforceth them every four or five months, which Port is always open, and his men and forces never wanting.</p>
               <p>This Province he eſpecially deſireth, for it lieth most fitly to annoy us; whither he may ſend Forces continually, and there have his Navy ready to annoy us: the which he could not otherwiſe ſo eaſily do, unleſs he had the Wind in a bag. Beſides, having this Province, he will keep us from Traffique to <hi>Rochel</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> as he doth in the <hi>Streights</hi> from <hi>Tripoly</hi> and St. <hi>Jean de luze;</hi> and ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from carrying forth or bringing in into this Land any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities whereby this Realm might be inriched, and her Majeſties Impoſt ever increaſed, being one of the greateſt Revenues of her Crown. He hath alſo gone about with them of <hi>Stode,</hi> and the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> one of his own Faction, and who, by reaſon he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do in that Kingdom what he liſteth, he may eaſily command him to impede or hinder our Traffique in thoſe Eaſtern parts; which if he could bring to paſs, you ſee how hurtful it would be to this Land.</p>
               <p>But, to deſcend yet more lower, and into theſe latter Actions, he hath ſeen it is but a folly to endeavour to make a wooden-bridge to paſs into <hi>England;</hi> therefore he hath found out a more ſure way,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107812:32"/>and ſtronger paſſage unto it by Land, and that by <hi>Scotland;</hi> which though it be not talked of at the Exchange, nor preached of at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, yet it is most true, and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as common as the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that he hath procured to him many of the Nobility there. It is true, he hath ſent thither no Navy; and if he had endeavoured it, her Majeſty would not have ſuffered him: yet do ſhe what ſhe can, ſome paltry Fly-boat may eſcape her Majeſties good Ships, and carry Gold enough in her to make them Traytors, and ſtir them to Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Theſe things her Majeſty underſtood before, and advertiſed that King thereof; but he not ſo well conceiving thereof, hath by the effect proved the other true. And unleſs I be deceived, the last Letter that came from thence the other night, ſheweth, that King is gone to make a Road into the North, and to bring Back the Lord <hi>Bothwell</hi> and the Lord <hi>Huntley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s malice thus dayly increaſeth against us, and ſeeketh alſo to ſtir up Sedition amongst us by his Inſtruments; the number alſo of Papiſts dayly increaſeth, or at leaſtwiſe be more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.</p>
               <p>My advice is, That you would conſult which ways to withſtand ſuch eminent dangers, which the greater they be, the ſooner they would be looked into and remembred. Wherefore, Mr. Speaker, I deſire ſome Committees ſhould be appointed of the ſufficientest and wiſest men in the Houſe, to conſider thereupon.</p>

               <p>FIrſt ſaying,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>John Wooley</hi>'s Speech.</note> That upon the cauſe of the danger the Realm was now in, and of the remedy, his Speech ſhould conſiſt; which he likened to a natural Body, which the more the principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was in danger, the greater means ſhould be uſed for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof. <hi>Roan</hi> being now made Admiral of <hi>France</hi> by the League, ſhould ſay he was a poor Admiral now, but that he doubted not but ſhortly he ſhould be able to bring ſuch a Navy to Sea, as ſhould terrifie the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> Alſo he ſhewed how the Princes of the Holy League had conſpired the Overthrow of this Realm, the Extirpation of Religion, and the Confuſion of her Majeſty and her Royal Subjects. And he exhorted the Houſe, now the ſeaſon of the year grows on, which called many of the Knights and Burgeſſes to be in their Countries, beſides the Sickneſs being in the Town, ſo that many of that Houſe knew not whether he lodged in a houſe infected or not, that they would ſeek to diſpatch and end the Parliament ſo ſoon as might be. He alſo ſhewed how the <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> troubled our Fiſher-men in ſmall Barques upon the Sea-coaſts; and ſo moved that this matter might be committed to ſome of the ſufficienteſt in the Houſe.</p>
               <p>He alſo exhorted the Houſe to a ſpeedy agreeing of a Subſidy; which, conſidering the dangers we were in, and that it was for our own good, as alſo for her Majeſties, he hoped no good Subject but would moſt willingly agree to it.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:107812:32"/>
               <p>Alſo he ſhewed, that the Wars which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> brought upon this Nation, had coſt her Majeſty a Million of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but this he avouched, that where it coſt her Majeſty one, it coſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> three.</p>

               <p>THey that ſpake before me, ſpake ſufficiently of the Authors of ours Troubles, and of the great danger which is now eminent upon us, inſomuch, that it is come to this point now, <hi>Non utrum imperare, ſed utrum vivere:</hi> I will ſpeak of nothing but that which concerns my Calling. Her Majeſty not onely being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the preſervation of her own Realm, but of her Neighbours alſo; ſhe hath not onely defended her own Subjects from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, but alſo hath aided Strangers which wanted money, with whom otherwiſe it would have gone very ill by this time, and alſo with our ſelves; inſomuch that the burthen of four Kingdoms hath reſted upon her Majeſty, and maintained with her Purſe, <hi>England, France, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> For how could the French King at his first coming to the Crown, have held out against thoſe Leaguers, had not her Majeſty aſſiſted him with her men and money? which hath cost her Majeſty above <hi>100000 l. :</hi> for 'tis well known the French King had not been able to withſtand the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s coming into <hi>France,</hi> had it not been for our Engliſh-men and money. As for the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> it ſtood her Majeſty yearly, ever ſince ſhe undertook the defence of them, in <hi>150000 l. </hi> all which her Majeſty beſtowed, for the good of this Realm, to free us from War at home. Beſides, when her Majeſty came to the Crown, ſhe found it four Millions indebted; her Navy, when ſhe came to view it, ſhe found it greatly decayed: Yet all this ſhe hath diſcharged, and thanks be to God ſhe is nothing indebted. And now ſhe is able to match any Prince in <hi>Europe;</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found, when they came to invade us; yea, ſhe hath with her Ships compaſſed the whole world, whereby this Land is made famous through all Nations.</p>
               <p>She did finde her Navy furniſhed onely with Iron Pieces, but ſhe hath furniſhed it with Artillery of Braſs; ſo that one of her Ships is not a Subjects, but rather a petty Princes wealth.</p>
               <p>As for her own private Expences, they have been little; in Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſhe hath conſumed little or nothing; and for her Apparel, it is Royal and Princely, becoming her Calling, but not ſumptuous or exceſſive; the Charges of her houſe ſmall, yea never leſs in any Kings time; and ſhortly, by Gods grace, ſhe will free her Subjects from that trouble which hath come by the means of Purveyors.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſhe truſteth that every good Subject will aſſist her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with his Purſe, ſeeing it concerns his own good, and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his eſtate: for before any of us would loſe the least member of his body, we would beſtow a great deal, and ſtick for no cost or charges, how much more ought we in this politick body, whereof not onely a member, but the whole body is in jeopardy, if we do not make haſte to the preſervation of it? And for theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107812:33"/>which are granted to her Majeſty now-a-days, they are leſs by half than they were in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
               <p>Now, although her Majeſty hath borrowed ſome money of her Subjects, beſides her Subſidies, yet hath ſhe truely repaid every one fully. <hi>He deſired the matter might be put to a Committee to conſider of.</hi>

               <p>I did take great contentment in her Majeſties Speech the other day, delivered by the Lord Keeper; how that it was a thing not to be done ſuddenly, or at one Parliament, nor ſcarce a year would ſuffice to purge the Statute-book, nor leſſen it, the Volume of Laws being ſo many in number, that neither common people can half practiſe them, nor the Lawyers ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, than the which nothing would tend more to the praiſe of her Majeſty. The <hi>Romans,</hi> they appointed ten men who were to correct or recall all former Laws, and to ſet forth thoſe twelve Tables ſo much of all men commended. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> likewiſe appointed ſix to that purpoſe. And <hi>Lewis</hi> the the ninth King of <hi>France,</hi> did the like in reforming his Laws.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Speaker.</speaker>
               <p>YEſterday a great Member of this Houſe, after a Speech uſed, and his Reaſons laid forth, delivered two Bills unto me; which Bills, though not being read, yet were diverſly ſpoken of. They being long, and the matters grave and of great importance, and the day being almost ſpent, I deſired further time to conſider of the parts of the Bill: I humbly thank this honourable Houſe, time was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me freely, it being almost twelve of the clock.</p>
               <p>I have peruſed and read both of the Bills; I have them about me, and they have been continually with me ever ſince they were delivered to me; never any man ſaw them, nor ever any mans eye more than my own ever ſaw one word of them.</p>
               <p>A little after I had peruſed the Bills, I was ſent for by a ſpecial Meſſenger from her Majeſty: Coming in her Royal preſence, I was commanded to deliver theſe words from her most excellent Majeſty unto the body of the Realm (for ſo ſhe termed this Houſe:) The matter I have to ſpeak is great, yea it is the greatest matter I ever had to deal in; wherefore I pray God direct <hi>mentem &amp; linguam hanc.</hi> I must be ſhort, for her Majeſties words were not many; and I may perhaps fail in the delivery of them: for though my Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors be great, yet who is ſo impudent that the preſence of ſuch a Majeſty would not appale him? and it did greatly fear me, when I did ſee none of theſe honourable perſons in her preſence who were preſent at the holding of the matter in this Houſe; yet ſo God in his providence had appointed it, that even in this while came in ſome of the perſons here preſent, who, if I fail in delivering what was given me in charge, can report it unto you: and I glad am that there are witneſſes with me in this action what was my faithful ſervice for the Houſe.</p>
               <p>I protest a greater comfort never befel me, than that this my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and faithful Promiſe to this Houſe, is not violated; for her Majeſty, in her most gracious wiſdom, before my coming determined not to preſs me in this, neither indeed did ſhe require the Bill of me; for this onely ſhe required of me: What were the things ſpoken of by the Houſe? which points I onely delivered, as they that heard me can tell.</p>
               <p>The Meſſage delivered me from her Majeſty,<note place="margin">The Speaker <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Commons.</note> conſiſteth of three things: Firſt, the end for which the Parliament was called. Secondly, the Speech which her Majeſty uſed by my Lord Keeper. Thirdly, what her Pleaſure and Commandment now is.</p>
               <p>For the first, it is in me and my power (I ſpeak now in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties perſon) to call Parliaments, and it is in my power to end and determine the ſame; it is in my power to aſſent or diſſent to any thing done in Parliament.</p>
               <p>The calling of this Parliament was onely that the Majeſty of God might be more religiouſly ſerved, and thoſe that neglect this ſervice might be compelled by ſome ſharper means to a more due obedience, and more true ſervice of God, than there hath been hitherto uſed.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107812:34"/>And further, that the ſafety of her Majeſties Perſon, and of this Realm, might be by all means provided for against our great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her Majeſties most excellent Pleaſure being then delivered unto us by the Lord Keeper, it was not meant we ſhould meddle with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State, or in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical; (for ſo her Majeſty ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them.) She wondered that any would be of ſo high command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attempt (I uſe her own words) a thing contrary to that which ſhe had ſo expreſly forbidden; wherefore with this ſhe was highly diſpleaſed. And becauſe the words then ſpoken by my Lord Keeper, are not now perhaps well remembred, or ſome be now here that were not there, her Majeſties preſent Charge and expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is, That no Bills touching matters of State, or Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, be exhibited: And upon my Allegiance, I am commanded, if any ſuch Bill be exhibited, not to read it.</p>

He ſhewed how on every ſide he had beleaguered us.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Denmark,</hi> that King being young, he hath corrupted the Council and Nobility ſo, as it was very likely he would ſpeed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of Shipping from thence; in the Marine-Towns of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and in <hi>Norway,</hi> he hath laid in great ſtore of Shipping; in <hi>France,</hi> he hath the Parliament-Towns at his command; in <hi>Britain,</hi> he hath all the beſt Havens; and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he hath ſo corrupted the Nobility, that he had promiſed them Forces to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Papiſts; that they were ready to joyn with any forreign Forces that would make them ſtrong, to be by themſelves, and to reſiſt others: for as he thought, there were not ſix Gentlemen of that Country to be of one Religion.

At his coming, he fully reſolveth to get <hi>Plimouth,</hi> or at leaſt to poſſeſs ſome of the Havens this Summer within our Land, and <hi>Plimouth</hi> is in moſt danger; for no Ordnance can be carried thither to remove him, the paſſages will not give leave.</p>
               <p>Now the way to defeat him, was this: To ſend a Royal Army and ſupplant him in <hi>Britany,</hi> and to poſſeſs our ſelves there; and to ſend a ſtrong Navy to Sea, and to lie with it upon the <hi>Cape</hi> and at <hi>Lambuck,</hi> to which places comes all his Ships with Riches from all places; and then they may ſet upon all that comes.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Beale.</note> by reaſon it was conceived by the Lords the other day, that upon his Motion, and by the Preſident he ſhewed, the Houſe was led to deny a Conference with the Lords: he acknowledged he miſtook the Queſtion appointed; for there being but a Conference deſired by the Lords, and no confirming of what they had done, he thought we might, and thought fit we ſhould confer: And to this end, he onely ſhewed the Preſident, That in the ninth year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. the Commons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving granted a Subſidy, which the Lords thought too little, and they agreed to a greater; and would have had the Commons to confirm that they had done. This the Commons thought they could not do, without prejudice to their honour: Wherefore he acknowledged himſelf miſtaken in the Queſtion, and deſired if any were led by him, to be ſatisfied, for that he would have been of another opinion, if he had conceived the matter as it was meant.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Rob. Cecill.</note> becauſe I must include an Anſwer to three Speeches. Thoſe two honourable perſons which ſit above, the one of them declared the true ſtate of the Queſtion, the other, what was ſit we ſhould do; but my Anſwer ſhall tend onely to the other Tales that followed.</p>
               <p>The first was a kind of ſatisfaction for a former miſtaking, but in the ſame ſatisfaction a new miſtaking was alſo; which was by way of information, caſting it into the Houſe, that the Queen ſhould ſeem to demand three Subſidies. Now the Queen never demanded three, nor one: ſo here is a new miſtaking added to the former ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. The ſecond mans Motion thus far I allow, that the Councels of this Houſe be ſecretly kept, and that nothing be reported in <hi>Malam partem;</hi> but if his meaning be, that we may not impart any thing that is done here unto the Queen, but that all things must be kept ſecret from her, I am altogether against it. This onely I ſhould deſire, what ought to be obſerved, that nothing ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported unto her in <hi>Malam partem.</hi> The third mans Motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon three points: The first, was News; the ſecond, Hiſtory; the third and last, a Motion. His News was, that mens Names were given up to the Queen; this was News, for I heard it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Hiſtory was, a large Report of the whole progreſs of this matter. His Motion was, that we ſhould confer with the Lords about a Subſidy, but not conclude a Subſidy with them. His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems contrary to his meaning, or elſe is more than ever was meant; for it was never deſired of us by the Lords, that we ſhould confer with them about a Subſidy.</p>

               <p>This Motion being well liked, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was deſired by the Houſe to repeat it again, that ſo it might be the better heard of them all.</p>
               <p>And thereupon he ſaid, That touching the aforeſaid Queſtion, which had receiv'd a No upon <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, he would not make it a Queſtion again; for by the Order of the Houſe he could not, but propound this for a new Queſtion, in theſe or the like words.</p>

                        <hi>as heretofore ſhe hath ever had, to preſerve her Kingdoms in Peace, and ſafe from all forreign Attempts, hath cauſed her at this preſent to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this honourable and great Council of her Realm, to adviſe of the best and most needful means whereby to continue this her peaceable and happy Government, and to withſtand the malice of her mighty and implacable Enemy; which hitherto, by the ſpace of many years, through her provident and Princely wiſdom, hath been performed, to the great and ineſtimable benefit of her Subjects, as that the ſimplest amongst them could not but ſee, and the wiſest but admire their happineſs therein; the whole Realm enjoying Peace in all ſecurity, when our Neighbour-Countries have been torn in pieces, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with cruel and bloody Wars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This her Majeſty is pleaſed to aſcribe to the mighty power and infinite mercy of the Almighty: And therefore it ſhall well become us all, most thank-fully upon the knees of our hearts, to acknowledge no leſs unto his holy Name; who of his infinite goodneſs ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her Highneſs, and ſend her many years more over us in all happineſs to reign.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In this her bleſſed Government her Highneſs chief care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of all, hath been of the honour and ſervice of the Almighty God, that true Religion might be planted and entertained in the hearts of her People through all the parts of her Realms; and as well in that behalf, as for the peace and benefit of her Subjects, ſhe hath from time to time eſtabliſhed many good Laws to meet with the Diſorders, and to puniſh the offences of wicked and ungodly men, that continuing in their bad ways, they may not be hardened and go forward in their wickedneſs: for</hi> Mora in peccato, dat incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ſceleri. <hi>And whereas the number of the Laws already made are very great, ſome alſo of them being obſolete andworn out of uſe; others idle and vain, ſerving to no purpoſe; ſome again over-heavy and too ſevere for the offence; others too looſe and ſlack for the faults they are to puniſh; and many of them ſo full of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be underſtood, that they cauſe many controverſies and much trouble amongst the Subjects:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You are to enter into a due conſideration of the ſaid Laws; and where you finde ſuperfluity, to prune and cut off; where defect, to ſupply; and were ambiguity, to explain; that they be not burthen-ſome, but profitable to the Common-wealth: Which being a ſervice of importance, and very needful to be required, yet as nothing is to be regarded, if due means be not had to withſtand the malice and force of thoſe profeſſed Enemies which ſeeks the deſtruction of the whole State,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This, before all, and above all, is to be thought of, and with most endeavour and care to be provided for: for in vain are Laws made, and to little purpoſe will they ſerve, be they never ſo good, if ſuch prevail as go about to make a Conquest of the Kingdom, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the People.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Wars heretofore were wont to be made either out of Ambition to enlarge Deminions, or out of Revenge to requite Injuries; but this against us is not ſo; In this the holy Religion of God is ſought to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107812:43"/>be rooted out, the whole Realm to be ſubdued, and the precious life of her excellent Majeſty to be taken away; which hitherto, by the powerful hand and great goodneſs of the Almighty, have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, maugre the Devil, the Pope, the Spaniſh Tyrant, and all the miſohievous deſignes of all her Enemies.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Wherefore it is high time that this be looked into, and that no way be left unſought, nor means unuſed, that may ſerve for defence thereof. Her Majeſty hath not ſpared to disburſe a maſs of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to ſell her Land for the maintenance of her Armies by Sea and Land, whereby, with ſuch ſmall helps as from her Subjects hath been yielded, ſhe hath defended and kept ſafe her Dominions from all ſuch forcible attempts as have been made; which being ſtill to be performed by infinite Charge, her Majeſty notwithſtanding hears of nothing more unwillingly than of Aids and Subſidies to be received from her People; though what ſhe doth receive, ſhe doth carefully beſtow, and infinitely more of her own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Taxations at this day, howſoever they ſeem, are nothing ſo great as heretofore in the Reigns of former Kings they have been. In the times of</hi> Edw. 3. <hi>and the two next before him, and thoſe three which ſucceeded next after him, the payments of the Commons then did far exceed any that have been ſince her Majeſties Reign; which is of Record in the Hiſtories of thoſe times to be ſeen: but never cauſe ſo great to employ great ſums of money, as now.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now therefore you are to conſider how to provide needful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Aid, in ſome meaſure, to maintain and ſupport her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Charge which at preſent ſhe is at, and is to continue at, for the defence of the Realm. He cannot be well adviſed, which in this caſe will not be forward to contribute and beſtow whatſoever he hath: for if with the Common-wealth it goes not well, well it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be with any private or particular perſon. That being in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he that would ſeek then to lay up Treaſure and inrich himſelf, ſhould be like to him that would buſie himſelf to beautifie his houſe, when the City wherein he dwelleth is on fire; or to him that deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up his Cabin, when the Ship wherein he ſaileth is ready to ſink. To ſpare in that caſe, is to ſpare for thoſe which ſeek to devour all; and to give, is to give to our ſelves. Her Majeſties part being onely carefully to beſtow what is delivered into her hands, wherein men performing their duties, there is no cauſe at all to fear: for the War is just; it is in defence of the Religion of God, of our most gracious Soveraign, of our Native Country, of our Wives, Children, Liberties, Lands, Lives, and whatſoever we have.</hi>

And, to you of the Houſe of Commons, that you may orderly proceed, and wiſely conſult of theſe weighty Cauſes delivered unto you, her Majeſties pleaſure is, You ſhould, according to your accuſtomed manner, go down to the Lower Houſe, and there make choice of ſome grave, learned, and wiſe man amongst you, to be

For, whereas on the 14th inſtant, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> Kt. with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others of the Lower Houſe, were ſent to the Lords to deliver a certain Meſſage to this Houſe; after conſultation had thereupon by the Lords, and after ſignification thereof given to the ſaid Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rawleigh,</hi> and the reſt (ſtaying in the outward room for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer) that they might come in and receive the ſame; it was thought meet, that the Lord Keeper ſhould deliver the ſaid Anſwer ſitting in his place, and every of the Lords keeping their places, and not going out to the Bar, as the uſe and form is when the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive either Bills or Meſſage from the Lower Houſe; and as the Lords had done once or twice before, by errour, or not attending the Formality and Order of the Houſe in that point.

            <p>Upon which Meſſage, the Lords having conſulted and delivered their Opinions touching that Order and Cuſtome of the Houſe, as it had been obſerved, and particularly noted by ſome of them that were the moſt antient and of longeſt continuance in Parliament, and eſpecially by the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> Lord Treaſurer, the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Parliament man of any that are at this preſent, either of the Upper or the Lower Houſe; and likewiſe by the Lord Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and by the Lord Admiral, the Lord <hi>North,</hi> the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107812:50"/>Lord <hi>Buckhurſt,</hi> and others, that had been preſent at many Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>It was reſolved,<note place="margin">The reſolution of the Lords upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</note> That the Order and Uſage of this Houſe was, and is, that when any Bills or Meſſages be brought from the Lower Houſe, to be preferred to the Upper Houſe, the Lord Keeper and the reſt of the Lords are to riſe from their places, and to go down to the Bar, there to meet ſuch as come from the Lower Houſe, and from them to receive in that place their Meſſages or Bills. But, contrary wiſe, when any Anſwer is to be delivered by the Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in the name and behalf of this Houſe, to ſuch Knights and Burgeſſes as came from the Lower Houſe, the ſaid Knights and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes are to receive the ſame ſtanding towards the lower end of the Houſe without the Bar. And the Lord Keeper is to deliver the ſame ſitting in his place, with his head covered, and all the Lords keeping their places; and that whenſoever it had been done otherwiſe, the ſame was by errour, or miſtaking, and therefore not to be drawn into an Example or Preſident, as it was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Lord Keeper this day, and the reſt of the Lords, that the going of the ſaid Lord Keeper and the reſt of the Lords from their places, unto the Bar, ſome few days before, once or twice, to give anſwer to ſome of the Lower Houſe, whereof the Lower Houſe ſeemed to take ſome advantage, was onely by miſcogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, or rather for want of due remembrance at the preſent of the Order and Cuſtome of this Houſe; whereunto, their Lordſhips having regard rather to the diſpatch of matters of importance in the Houſe, than to Formalities, were not greatly intentive.</p>
            <p>This to have been the ancient uſage of the Houſe, and that the ſame ought ſtill to be, was concluded by common and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Lords, both upon particular remembrance, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the like courſe and Order holden afore-time, by other Lords that held the place in the Houſe of Lord-Chancellor and Lord Keeper, and alſo by divers reaſons, urged and alleadged, to prove and ſhew that the ſaid Order doth beſt ſtand with the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and gravity of the Houſe, and with the conveniency and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for diſpatch of Affairs appertaining to the Parliament; and that the contrary courſe is both indecent and inconvenient.</p>
            <p>This being ſo reſolved and concluded,<note place="margin">The Lords ſend to the Commons to come up and know their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions.</note> it was agreed, that Mr. Atturney-General and Mr. Serjeant <hi>Drewe</hi> ſhould go down to the Lower Houſe, and ſignifie from the Lords to the Knights and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, That if they would ſend any of that Houſe up to the Lords, to receive Anſwer unto their aforeſaid Demand, Anſwer ſhould be given them.

His advice was, that Laws in force might be reviſed and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no new Laws made.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes of the Wars, he laid down to be, that they were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to God, the Queen, and the Peace of this Kingdom: that they conſpired to overthrow Religion, and to reduce us to a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Servitude.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two Enemies he named to be, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Our Eſtate ſtanding thus, he adviſed us to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, by reaſon we deal with circumſpect Enemies, and ſaid, he was confident of good ſucceſs, becauſe God hath ever, and he hoped ever would bleſs the Queen with ſucceſsful fortune. He ſhewed how apparent his providence was; for by experience and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his tortering he giveth, the means and courſes he taketh for our inſtructions: And ſecondly, the ſucceſs we had againſt him by Gods ſtrong arm of defence in <hi>Anno</hi> 1588, and divers others times ſince.</p>
                     <p>You ſee to what effect the Queens ſupport of the French Kings Eſtate hath brought him to, even made him one of the greateſt Princes in <hi>Europe;</hi> yet when her Majeſties Forces there left him, how again he was fain to ranſome a ſervile Peace at the hands of our Enemies the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with diſhonourable and ſervile Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> how by her aid, from a confuſed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Eſtate, ſhe brought them to an unity in Council, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them with ſuch ſucceſs in her Attempts againſt the greateſt power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> tyrannical deſignes; which have ſo much gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, that how many deſperate practices have been both deviſed, conſented unto, and ſet on foot by the late King his Father, I need not ſhew you, nor trouble you with Arguments for proof thereof, being confeſſed by them that ſhould have been Actors themſelves thereof; but <hi>De mortuis nil niſi bonum.</hi> I would be loath to ſpeak ill of the dead, much more to ſlander the dead. I have ſeen her Majeſty wear at her Girdle the price of her own bloud; I mean, Jewels that have been given to her Phyſicians to have done that unto her which God will ever keep her from; but ſhe hath worn them rather in triumph, than for the price, that hath not been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.</p>

            <p>Her Majeſty, with divers Lords Spiritual and Temporal, being ſet in the Upper Houſe in their Parliament-Robes, between two and three of the clock this afternoon, the Knights, Citizens, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of the Houſe of Commons had notice thereof, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on repaired thither with <hi>John Crooke</hi> Eſq; their Speaker; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed at the Rail or Bar at the lower end of the ſaid Upper Houſe, after he had made three Reverences to her Majeſty ſitting under a rich Cloath of Eſtate, ſpake to the effect following.</p>
            <p>THat Laws were not firſt made with humane Pen,<note place="margin">The Speaker's Speech.</note> but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinance; that Politick Laws were made according to the evil condition of men; and that all Laws ſerves not at all times, no more than one Medicine for all Diſeaſes: and ſaid, if he were aſked what was the firſt and chiefeſt thing to be conſidered of, he would ſay, Religion: for Religion is all in all; for Religion breeds Devotion, Devotion breeds Zeal and Piety to God, which breedeth Obedience and Duty to the Prince; and Obedience to the Laws, breedeth Faithfulneſs, Honeſty, and Love, the three ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and onely things to be wiſhed and obſerved in a well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Commonwealth. And that her Majeſty, by planting true Religion, had laid ſuch a foundation, upon which all thoſe Vertues were planted and builded, that they could not eaſily be rooted up or extirpated: and therefore acknowledged, that we ought and do acknowledge, that we will praiſe God and her Majeſty for it.</p>
            <pb n="150" facs="tcp:107812:78"/>
            <p>And then he deſcended to ſpeak of Governments and Laws of Nations; amongſt which, principally and above all, he preferr'd the Laws of this Land; which, he ſaid, were ſo many and ſo wiſe, that there was almoſt no offence, but was met with in a Law: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her Majeſty being deſirous, for the good of her Land, to call a Parliament for redreſs of ſome Laws, and for making of new;</p>
            <p>Her dutiful and loyal Subjects, having conſidered of them, have made ſome new, and amended ſome old; which they humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may be made Laws by her Royal Aſſent, which giveth life unto them.</p>
            <p>And ſo, after thanks given for the Pardon, by which we dread your Juſtice and admire your Mercy, and a Prayer unto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, That ſhe would accept, as the teſtimony of our Loves and Duties offered unto her with a free heart and willing ſpirit, four entire Subſidies, and eight Fifteenths and Tenths, to be collected of our Lands and Livelihoods; in ſpeaking whereof, he miſtook, and ſaid, Four entire Fifteenths and eight Subſidies; which he was adviſed of by ſome of the Counſel that ſtood neer unto him, and ſo he ſpake it right: and craving pardon for his offence, if either he had forgotten himſelf either in word or action, he ended his Speech.</p>

And that no Prince was ever more unwilling to exact or receive any thing from the Subject than ſhe our moſt gracious Soveraign; for we all know ſhe never was a greedy Graſper, nor ſiraight-handed keeper: And therefore ſhe commanded
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107812:78"/>me to ſay, That you have done (and ſo ſhe taketh it) dutifully, plentifully, and thank-fully.</p>
                     <p>For your ſelf, Mr. Speaker, her Majeſty commanded me to ſay, That you have proceeded with ſuch wiſdom and diſcretion, that it is much to your commendations, and that none before you have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more. <hi>And ſo he ended, after an Admonition given to the Juſtices of Peace, That they would not deſerve the Epethites of prowling Juſtices, Juſtices of Quarrels, who counted Champerty good Cheveſance; ſinning Juſtices, who did ſuck and conſume the Good of this Commonwealth; and alſo againſt all thoſe that did lie, if not all the year, yet at leaſt three quarters of the year, in the City of</hi> London.</p>

               <note place="margin">Some of the Commons diſcontented.</note> in the Lower-houſe. So that after the Knights and Burgeſſes had ſtaid a good while, it was told them, That the Lord-keepers Speech was done, and thereupon every man went away diſcontented.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, whilſt her Majeſty was at Sermon, the Lord-Admiral came into the <hi>Court of Requeſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Admiral.</note> and there began to call the Knights and Burgeſſes by the Poil; and alſo, to ſwear them at the ſame time: But becauſe that courſe ſeemed too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he ſtaid, whilſt Sir <hi>William Knowls,</hi> Controuler of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Sir <hi>John Stanhopp</hi> Vice-Chamberlain, Sir <hi>Robert Cicil,</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Secretary of State; and <hi>John Herbert</hi> Eſquire, ſecond Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, came; who were all coming up from the Upper houſe together, and then only the Knights and Burgeſſes were called; After that, the Lord <hi>Admiral,</hi> and Mr. Secretary <hi>Cicil,</hi> went up to the Upper-houſe; but Mr. <hi>Controuler,</hi> Sir <hi>John Stanhopp,</hi> and Mr. Secretary <hi>Herbert,</hi> went to the ſpace before the Parliament Houſe door; where they ſware all the Lower-houſe confuſedly, four at one time, ſix at another, eight at another, taking their names that ſwore; and who not: and ſtill as every man was Sworn, he went into the houſe, and to his place, as beſt liked him.</p>
            <p>VVhen all were Sworn, and the Queen come to the Upper-Houſe,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107812:80"/>and the Lord-Keepers ſpeech ended: Then all the Privy Councel of the Lower-houſe, came in thither, and ſate quiet a while; and then putting their heads together, Mr. Controuler ſtood up, and ſpake to this effect.</p>
            <q>
               <p>That it was an Antient Cuſtom in that Houſe,<note place="margin">The Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouler ſpeaks firſt.</note> that at thoſe times, ſome Man ſhould break ſilence; and I muſt confeſs at this time, it belongs to my place. It is needleſs to ſhew the uſe of this Houſe, becauſe its well known to all, or moſt here. All men knows, that the ſpeech of a multitude breedeth confuſion, and diſſention. It is therefore fit for us to chuſe one, to be our Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; which for his experience may ſpeak, and for his ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, dare and can ſpeak on all our Behalfs and Affairs; Neither doth it ſtand with the Honor, and Antient Uſage of this Houſe, to ſpeak but by one. Neither is it anſwerable to the State of her Majeſty, to deliver unto her our mindes, by the Tongues of a confuſed Multitude. Then we are to fall into conſideration, what manner of perſon he ſhall be.

               <p>Now, having delivered unto you, the neceſſity of a Speaker, and his qualities; I will deliver unto you my Opinion, whom I think fit for the place, referring it to your conſideration; and for my own part,<note place="margin">He Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Recorder of <hi>London</hi> for their Speaker, who ſeems to Admire at it.</note> not prejudicing the VVorth of any in this Houſe, I deem Mr. <hi>John Crook,</hi> Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> a moſt fit, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and able man for this Service.</p>

            <q>
               <p>I do not attribute ſo much to mine own Choice, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to aſſure you, there is no Man here fitter for the ſame than he is; but I only make bold to deliver my Opinion, leaving the choiſe of him, or any other to the free Election of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Member of this Houſe.</p>
               <p>And for the motion which hath been made, touching the keeping out of the houſe, during the time of the Lord Keepers Speech; I do aſſure you, it was not willingly done, but through Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Groom of the Chamber; but if the Houſe be deſirous to hear the Effect thereof, I will intreat ſome that were there at that time, to ſatisfiy their deſires. (The cauſe of which precloſe was, for that one Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> during the time of the Commons ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made a complaint to Mr. <hi>Controuler,</hi> ſitting in the Houſe, that they toook it in great diſgrace, that they were ſhut out.</p>
            </q>
            <p>After which Speech, the Council ſate ſilent a while; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Mr. Controuler ſtood up again, and asked the Houſe of their conſent,<note place="margin">The Houſe Votes for him</note> and opinions to his Motion; Whereupon every man cryed, <hi>I, I, I.</hi>

            <p>So ſitting down, and the Houſe a little while quiet,<note place="margin">They Chuſe him.</note> Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouler</hi> asked, If they agreed as before? and all Anſwered, <hi>I, I, I.</hi>

            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Controuler</hi> and Sir <hi>John Stanhop</hi> roſe up; and Sir <hi>John Stanhop</hi> on the right hand, and Mr. <hi>Controuler</hi> on the left,<note place="margin">He is Lead to the Chair.</note> lead him to the Speakers Seat; where ſtanding, without any ſitting down as yet, he pawſing a while, ſpake again in effect as Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Your honourable Choice of me, without any my deſert,<note place="margin">Speaks to the Houſe.</note> ſtops me from pleading either Inſuficiency, or Diſability; leſt I ſhould ſhew, and make my weakneſs more apparent, to diſapprove the Senſure and good allowance of the Honourable Aſſembly of this Houſe. But however, it hath pleaſed you to inable me in this ſort; This I dare and can aſſure you, that you might have choſen many more worthy, but none more ready to ſhew his utmoſt indeavor in this ſervice. Which Choice, ſeeing it hath proceeded out of your Favour undeſerved on my part, I ſhall indeavor, as God ſhall enable me, to ſhew my ſelf for this Aſſembly, moſt careful, and to every particular Member, moſt reſpective, and thankful.</p>
            </q>
            <p>VVhereupon he ſate down, and put on his Hat: And after a little ſitting, and pawſe, Sir <hi>William Knowls,</hi> Controuler, roſe up and ſaid, It was her Majeſties pleaſure, that we ſhould be ready to preſent our Speaker on <hi>Friday</hi> next, at two of the Clock in the afternoon.

After, being come in, the Upper Houſe was ſate, and the Queen under the State, the <hi>Speaker,</hi> ſtanding at the Bar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, made three Reverences; which done, he made a Speech to her Majeſty to the effect following.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Moſt Sacred and mighty Soveraign;<note place="margin">The Speakers Speech to the Queen.</note> upon your Majeſties Command, your moſt dutiful and loving Commons, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the lower Houſe, have choſen me,

And that it would pleaſe you, to command your Commons to make a new Election of another more able and ſufficient, to diſcharge the great ſervice to be appointed by your Majeſty, and your Subjects.</p>
               <p>And I beſceech your moſt Excellent Majeſty, not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret my denyal herein, to proceed from my unwillingneſs to perform all devoted dutiful Service: But rather out of your Majeſties Clemency and Goodneſs, to interpret the ſame, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from that inward fear and trembling, which hath poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me when heretofore, (with moſt gratious Audience) it hath pleaſed your Majeſty, to Licence me to ſpeak before you. For I know, and muſt acknowledge, that under God, even through your Majeſties great bounty and favour, I am that I am. And therefore none of your Majeſties moſt dutiful Subjects, more bound to be ready, and being ready, to perform the leaſt of your Majeſties Commands.</p>
               <p>I do therefore, moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty, that in regard the ſervice of ſo great a Prince, and flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, may the better and more ſucceſſively be effected, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand your dutiful and loving Commons, the Knights, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and Burgeſſeſs of the Lower Houſe, to proceed to a new Election.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then, after he had made three Reverences, the Queen cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lord Keeper, to whom ſhe ſpake ſomething in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. And after that, the Lord Keeper ſpake in effect as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. Speaker,<note place="margin">The Lord Keeper Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers by the Queens Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note> Her Majeſty, with gratious Attention, having heard your wiſe and grave Excuſe; for your diſcharge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to ſay unto you, That even your eloquent Speech, in excuſe of your ſelf, is a great Motive, and a Reaſon very perſwaſive, both to ratify and approve of the Choice of her loving Commons, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to commend their wiſe and diſcreet Choiſe of your ſelf, in her gratious Senſure, both for Sufficiency well Able, and for your fidelity and ſervice, well Approved of; and therefore, her Majeſty taketh this Choice of yours, for <hi>bonum omen,</hi> a ſign of good and happy Succeſs, when the beginning is taken in hand with ſo great Wiſdom and Diſcretion: Her Majeſty therfore, Commanded me to ſay unto you, That ſhe well liketh of your Election, and therefore ſhe Ratifieth it, with her Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Conſent.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then, Mr. Speaker making three low Reverences, Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107812:81"/>in this ſort. <q rend="inline">Moſt ſacred and moſt puiſſant queen, ſeeing it hath pleaſed your to command my ſervice; by conſenting to the free Election of your dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Knights,<note place="margin">The <hi>Speakers</hi> ſecond Speech</note> Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons, of me to be their Speaker: I moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty, to give me leave to ſhew unto you, the dutiful thoughts, and earneſt affections of your loyal ſubjects, to do your Majeſty all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to defend your Sacred and Royal Perſon, both with their Lives &amp; Goods againſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And ſo made a vehement invective againſt the Tyranny of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Popes ambition, and the Rebells in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which he ſaid, were like a Snake cut in pieces, which did crawl and creep to joyn themſelves together again. And laſtly, with prayers, to continue the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Eſtate and Peace of this Land, which had been defended, as he ſaid, by the mighty Arm of our Dread and Sacred Queen. (To which ſhe anſwered openly her ſelf, <hi>No, but by the mighty hand of God,</hi> Mr. Speaker.) Then he proceeded to the laſt part, to beſeech her Majeſty for freedom of Speech to every particular member: For acceſſe to here Perſon, liberty of Priviledg to all the Members of this Houſe, and their Servant. And laſtly, if any miſtaking of any Meſſage (delivered unto him from the Commons) ſhould happen, that her Majeſty would be pleaſed to attribute that to his weakneſs, in delivery or underſtanding, and not to the Houſe: As alſo, any forgetfulneſs, through want of memory; or that things were not ſo judicially handled, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by him, as they were deliver'd by the Houſe. To which, after the Queen had ſpoken to the Lord Keeper again; the Lord Keeper ſpake in effect, as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. Speaker, her Majeſty doth greatly commend,<note place="margin">The Lord-Keeper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, by the Queens Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> and like of your grave Speech, well divided, and well contrived; the firſt proceeding from a ſound Invention, and the other from a ſetled Judgment and Experience: You have well, and well indeed, weighed the ſtate of this Kingdome, well obſerv'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our puiſſant, and great Empire, the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> the continual and exceſſive charges of the Wars of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which if they be well weighed, do not only ſhew the prudence of our gratious Soveraign, in defending of us; but alſo, the greatneſs of the charge continually beſtowed by her Majeſty, even out of her own Revenues, to protect us; and the expoſing of her Majeſties ſelf to continual troubles, and toileſome Cares, for the benefit and ſafety of her Subjects.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, Mr. Speaker, it behoveth us to think, and ſay, as was deliver'd by a great man lately, in a <hi>Concilio ad Clerum, opus est ſubſidio, ne fiai exitum;</hi> or as I think, <hi>excedium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching your other Requeſts: <hi>Firſt,</hi> For freedom of Speech, her Majeſty willingly Conſenteth thereunto, with this cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That the matter be not ſpent in Idle and Vain matters, Painting out the ſame with Froth, and Volubility of words.</p>
               <p>And her Majeſty Commandeth, That you ſuffer not any Speeches made for Contention, or Contradiction-ſake, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107812:82"/>only by a Tempeſt of words; whereby the Speakers may ſeem to get ſome reputed Credit, by imboldning themſelves to maintain Contradiction, and on purpoſe to trouble the Houſe with vain and long Orations, to hinder the Proceedings in more weighty and greater Importance.</p>
               <p>Touching Acceſs to her Perſon, ſhe moſt willingly granteth the ſame; deſiring ſhe may not be troubled, unleſs urgent and matters of great Conſequence compel you thereunto. For this hath been held for a wiſe Maxime, <hi>In troubling great Eſtates, you muſt trouble ſeldome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Liberty unto your ſelves, and ſervants, her Majeſty hath Commanded me to ſay unto you all, That ſhe ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to preſerve the Liberty of the Houſe; and granteth Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the meaneſt Follower of the meaneſt Member of this Houſe.</p>
               <p>But, her Majeſties Pleaſure is, you ſhould not maintain, and keep with you, notorious Perſons, either for Life, or Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; As deſperate Debtors, who never come abroad, fearing her Laws, but at theſe times. Petty Foggers, and Vipers of the Common Wealth; prouling and common Solicitors, that ſets Diſſention between man and man, and men of the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to theſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe her Majeſty earneſtly deſireth, a Law may be made againſt; as alſo that no Member of this Parliament would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain, or bolſter up any man on the like Humor, or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, on pain of her Highneſſes Diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>For the Excuſe of the Houſe, and your ſelf, Her Majeſty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth me to ſay, That your Sufficiency hath ſo often times been approved before her, That She doubteth not of the Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Diſcharge of the Place you ſhall ſerve in.</p>
               <p>Wherein, ſhe willeth you, to have a ſpecial Eye, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; not to make new and idle Laws, and trouble the Houſe with them: But rather to look to the Abridging, and Repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of diverſe obſolete and ſuperfluous Statutes.</p>
               <p>As alſo, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To take in hand Matters of greateſt Moment and Conſequence; In doing thus, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> you ſhall fulfil her Majeſties Commandment, do your Country good, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy Her Majeſties Expectation.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Which being ſaid, the Speaker made three Reverences to the Queen. Then the Lord Keeper ſaid; <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>For certain great and weighty Cauſes, Her Highneſs's Pleaſure is, the Parliament ſhall be Adjourned until</hi> Friday <hi>next.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which Speech, was taken to be an Adjournment of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Houſe, but it was not ſo meant; wherefore the Lower Houſe ſate the next day, being <hi>Saturday</hi> morning.</p>
            <p>So, after ſome room made, the <hi>Queen</hi> came through the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> to go into the <hi>Painted-Chamber,</hi> who graciouſly offering her Hand to the <hi>Speaker,</hi> he kiſſed it; but not one word ſhe ſpake unto him, neither, as ſhe went through the <hi>Commons;</hi> few ſaid, <hi>God</hi> bleſs your Majeſty, as they were wont in all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107812:82"/>great Aſſemblies. And the throng being great, and little room to paſs, ſhe moved her Hand to have more room; whereupon one of the Gentlemen Uſhers ſaid openly, <hi>Back Maſters, make room.</hi> And one anſwered ſtoutly, behind, <hi>If you will Hang us, we can make no more room:</hi> which the <hi>Queen</hi> ſeemed not to hear, though ſhe heaved up her Head, and looked that way towards him that ſpake. After, ſhe went to <hi>White-Hall</hi> by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, Octob.</hi> 31. I was not there, thinking the Houſe had not ſare till <hi>Thurſday;</hi> but I heard there was a motion made for the maintenance of the Priviledges of the Houſe, and to have a Committee for it; which was appointed on <hi>Thurſday</hi> at one of the Clock in the Afternoon. And two Bills were Read, one againſt Drunkenneſs; another, that no Biſhop, nor Arch-Biſhop, may make any Leaſe in <hi>Remainder,</hi> or Reverſion, until within three Years before the expiration of the former Leaſe.</p>
            <p>This Day, the Prayer was brought into the Houſe, which was appointed every Morning to be Read, during the ſitting of this Parliament, amongſt other Prayers, by a Miniſter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpoſe.</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Hobby,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Which ſpeech,<note place="margin">Seconded by Mr. Serjeant <hi>Harris.</hi>
               </note> was ſeconded by Mr. Serjeant <hi>Harris;</hi> who ſaid, <q rend="inline">That <hi>Anno</hi> 27. of the <hi>Queen,</hi> the like motion had been made, and that then by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of the time, and ſudden ending of the Parliament, nothing was done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; notwithſtanding (he ſaid) this motion, being now ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily made, in the beginning of the Parliament, he thought it fit, for his part, to deſerve a Commitment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He was Seconded again,<note place="margin">Then by Mr. <hi>Wiſeman.</hi>
               </note> by Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inn;</hi> who was of the ſame mind, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">That divers particular Laws, of his knowledge, were now both needleſs to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as alſo dangerous to the Subjects, by reaſon of the Penalties. So a Commitment was granted, divers Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees aſſigned; and <hi>Fryday</hi> in the Afternoon, at two of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107812:83"/>Clock in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber</hi> appointed for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Act was Read for Explanation of Statutes for Leaſes made by Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> ſhewed to the Houſe, That ſome particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers found themſelves aggrieved, That the antient Order for Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their Spur, before they came into the Parliament-Houſe, was not obſerved, which he prayed might be done; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would have Boots and Rapiers taken away; but nothing was done therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, November</hi> 3. The Act to preſerve the Breed of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and againſt the Stealing of them, was Read: And a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made therein, by Sir <hi>George Moore,</hi> who ſaid, <q rend="inline">That he feared, the Bill would not paſs, in that two Vouchers by this Bill muſt be; where by a former Statute, there is to be but one, and that very hardly obſerved. And beſides, the Law may be defrauded, becauſe a poor Man muſt ſell a Horſe, and ſo be voucher after, and then not able to anſwer the value.</q> So the Bill was Committed, and the Committees appointed to meet in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber,</hi> to Morrow in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>The Act to reſtrain the Exceſs and Abuſe uſed in Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Houſes;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> moves for Corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Alehouſe-Keepers.</note> and Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> moved, that bodily puniſhment might be inflicted on Alehouſe-Keepers that ſhould be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and alſo Proviſion made therein, to reſtrain Reſort to Alehouſes.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Bill, Sir <hi>George Moore</hi> made a Speech, againſt Drunkenneſs, and deſired ſome ſpecial Proviſion might be made againſt it: <q rend="inline">For, although there were Laws already againſt it, yet they did not reach grievous enough to the offence in that kind now Committed. And therefore, we muſt not be like Spiders, that always keep their old, and the ſame Webs, ſo allowing the ſame Laws which muſt alter with the times; and touching the Authority that is given to the Juſtices of Aſſize, and Juſtices of the Peace, by this Bill, That they ſhall aſſign Inns, and Inn-Keepers, I think that inconvenient: for an Inn is a Mans Inheritance, and they are ſet at great rates, and therefore, not to be taken away from any particular Man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another wiſh'd, that there might be a reformation of Ale, which is now made ſo ſtrong, that he offered to affirm it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, that it is commonly ſold for a Groat a Quart. <hi>It is as ſtrong as Wine, and will Burn like Sack.</hi>
            </p>

               <q rend="inline">Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I will only liken this Bill to the Suppreſſion of Stews and Bawdy-Houſes, in old time; That, where then all Whores and Bawds were together in one Houſe, now being ſuppreſſed, every Mans Houſe is a Bawdy-Houſe; ſo, if you take away Alehouſes, and hinder them from being Drunk there, it will be a ready way to make every Man Drunk at his own Houſe, at home.</q>

            <p>To which, Mr. <hi>Controuler</hi> made anſwer, That he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat Mr. Secretary <hi>Cicil,</hi> who was there, in regard he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to procure them the underſtanding of the Lord Keepers Speech, to deliver the Effect thereof.

               <p>My memory is frail, and I know my ſelf unable to Deliver Articulately, the Grave &amp; Learned Speech of that Wiſe and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Counſellor, who firſt ſpake it; For hard it is to tell a Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans tale after him, and therefore to particularize, I muſt plead my Excuſe: Seeing men of the beſt Sufficiency may forget, when ordinary Capacities may Remember; my mind was not then fit for Attention, when I had ſome cauſe of Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>He uſed perſwaſions of Thankfulneſs and Obedience, as alſo ſhewed her Majeſties Deſire of a Diſſolution of this Parliament before <hi>Chriſtmaſs;</hi> He ſhewed unto us the Neceſſity we ſtand in; and the means to prevent it; The neceſſity he ſaid is the Wars between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> the means to prevent it, Treaſure. His Adviſe was, that Laws in force might be Reviſited, and Explained, and no new Laws made. The Cauſe of the War he laid down to be, That they were Enemies to God, the Queen, and the Peace of this Kingdom; That they Conſpired to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Religion, and to Reduce us to a Tyrannical Servitude.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Enemies, he Named to be the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Our Eſtate being thus, He Summon'd us to be Provident and Confident; Provident, by reaſon we deal with a provident Enemy; and Confident, becauſe God hath ever, and I hope ever will, Bleſſe the Queen with Succeſſeful Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>He ſhewed how Apparent his Providence was: for by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Judgment, You know his Torturing he giveth, and the Means and Courſes he taketh for our Deſtruction. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Succeſs we have had againſt him, by Gods ſtrong-Arm of Defence in 1588. and diverſe times ſince. You ſee to what Effect the Queens Support of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Eſtate hath brought him unto, even made him one of the greateſt

For the Low-Countries, how by Her Aid, ſhe hath from a Confuſed Government, and Eſtate, brought them to an Unity of Council, and defended them with ſuch Succeſſe, in her Attempts againſt the greateſt Power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical deſigns: Which hath ſo much Gauled him, that how many deſperate Practiſes have been both Deviſed, Conſented unto, and ſet on Foot by Commandment of the late King his Father; I need not now ſhew you, nor trouble you with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Proof thereof, being Confeſſed by them, that ſhould have been Actors themſelves of thoſe bloody Deſigns, but <hi>De mortuus nil niſi bonum.</hi> I would be loath to ſpeak of the Dead, much more to ſlander the Dead. I have ſeen her Majeſty wear at her Girdle, the Price of her Blood; I mean Jewels which have been given to her Phyſitians, to have done that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, which I hope, God will ever keep from her; but ſhe hath worn them rather in Tryumph than for the Price, which hath not been greatly valuable.</p>
               <p>Then he fell to perſwade us, becauſe new Occaſions were Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe'rd of Conſultations to be Provident in Proviſion of means for our own Defence and Safety, ſeeing the King of <hi>Spain</hi> means to make <hi>England</hi> miſerable, with beginning with <hi>Ireland;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he begin with the Rebells, but even with the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Queen her ſelf.</p>
               <p>He ſhewed, that Treaſure muſt be our means; for Treaſure is the ſinews of War. Thus much that Honourable Perſon ſaid, from whom I proteſt I would diminiſh nothing, that ſhould be ſpoken of, if I could Remember more, or deliver it better: And I had rather wrong my ſelf than wrong him.</p>
               <p>For my own Adviſe, touching the particular Councils of this Houſe; I wiſh,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicil</hi> now gives his own advice.</note> that we would not trouble our ſelves with any Fantaſtick Speeches, or idle Bills; but rather, with ſuch as be for the general good, both light in Conception, and facile in Execution: Now, ſeeing it hath pleaſed you all, with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hitherto to hear me, If with your Favor, I may particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize, and ſhew the Grounds of the former Speech, touching the State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſhall be very glad, both for my own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and your Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> having quit himſelf of <hi>France,</hi> by a baſe and ſervile Peace, forgetteth not to follow the Objects of his Fathers Ambition. <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> he hath made diverſe Overtures of Peace to; which, if they might be both Honorable, and for the publick good, I hold him neither a Wiſe, nor an Honeſt man, that would Impugne them. He hath put an Army into <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Number Four Thouſand, under the Conduct of a valiant, expert, and hardy Captain, who Chooſeth, rather than to return to his own Country without any Famous Enterpriſe, to live and die in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:107812:85"/>
               <p>Theſe Four Thouſand, are three parts of them natural <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and of his beſt expert Soldiers, except them of the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> thoſe he would not ſpare, becauſe of his Enterpriſe of <hi>Oſtend;</hi> and how dangerous the loſs of that Town would be to this Land, I think there is no man of Experience but can Witneſs with me, that he would eaſily be Maſter of that Coaſt; and that the Trade between <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> were quite Diſſolved; yea, he would be ſo dangerous a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to us, that we which are Tenants at Diſcretion, are likely ſhortly to be Tenants by his Courteſie; when he is our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> what Neighbor hath <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom he ſhall not be a trouble?</p>
               <p>I will ſhew you further, what beſides this he hath done, and how <hi>Eagle-eyed</hi> he is ſtill over us. To reſiſt the <hi>Turks</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, he hath ſent Ten Thouſand Men. To the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> he hath ſent Nine Thouſand.

               <p>To reſiſt theſe Attempts in Being, and the enſuing proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt us, Let us conſider the certainty of our Eſtate in <hi>Ireland:</hi> We have there an Army, and nothing but an Army, fed even out of <hi>England:</hi> with what Charge it brings to the Queen, what Trouble to the Subject, what danger it is to them there left, if the Proviſion ſhould fail; What hurt to the Common-wealth, by making things at an higher Rate than otherwiſe they would be, I refer it to your Wiſdoms to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</p>
               <p>Over this, I aſſure you, It is beyond all Preſident and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, his Pretence and Cauſe of War there, is to deſend the Catholick Cauſe; I mean, to Tear her Majeſties Subjects from her; for I may ſay, ſhe hath no Catholick Obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there, becauſe ſhe ſtandeth Excommunicated at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, by force of two Bulls of this Popes, by which her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are Abſolved of their Obedience. That you do only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you do it; <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> yea we do it for a Prince, that deſireth not to draw any thing extraordinary out of the Coffers of her Subjects: She ſelleth her Land to Defend us; ſhe Supporteth all her Neighbor-Princes, to gain their Amity, and Eſtabliſh our long Peace; not theſe five, or ſeven, or ten Years, but Forty-three Years, for all our Proſperities: I hope I ſhall not ſee her Funeral, upon which may be Written, <hi>Hic Solum reſtat victrix Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis,</hi> and I pray God, I may not; what we freely give unto Her, ſhe living beſtows it to our Good; &amp; dying, doubtleſs, will leave it for our Profit. Thus have I out of my own Genius, for my own part, delivered unto you what I know: And touching that I have ſpoken, in performing your Commandment, I will take no thank from you for my Pains: For no man cares with leſs Affection to ſpeak in this Aſſembly, or deſireth to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy any particular Member of this Houſe, more than my ſelf.</p>

            <p>The Bill for Ale was denied to be Committed, and not put to the queſtion, whether it ſhould be Ingroſſed Yea, or No. But ſome Doubt made thereof, but as it ſeemeth, if the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting be denyed, it uſeth not to be Ingroſſed, becauſe the Houſe will not lightly paſs it.</p>

            <p>Mr. Serjant <hi>Harris</hi> moved the Houſe, That in reſpect great danger and inconvenience might grow by the want of any one particular Member of this Houſe, therefore he thought good to Certifie the want of a Knight for <hi>Rutlandſhire;</hi> for he ſaid, That Sir <hi>Andrew Noell,</hi> being the Sheriff of the County, had return'd himſelf jointly with Sir <hi>John Harrington</hi> to be Knights;<note place="margin">A Motion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Void Election; the Sheriff Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> which he took in Law, to be a void Return, becauſe it is againſt the expreſs Words of the Writ; which are, <hi>Ita quod neque tu, neque aliquis alius Vicecomes alterius Comitatus eligatur,</hi> &amp;c.

To the Biſhop preſent, in the Maintenance of his Eſtate, which cometh only by continual Fines; which, if they be taken away, then are they not able to maintain that Hoſpitality, or keep that Retinue either belonging to their Place, or anſwerable to their Living: For, conſider the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107812:86"/>of the greateſt Biſhoprick in <hi>England;</hi> it is but <hi>Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> and <hi>Two Hundred Pounds, per Annum;</hi> whereof he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for <hi>Annual</hi> Subſidy to the <hi>Queen, Five Hundred Pounds.</hi> And what Damage we ſhall do both to him, and his Succeſſor here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, his Revenue being ſo Beneficial to her Majeſty, I refer to all your Judgments. To the Succeſſor it muſt needs be more hurtful; for when he firſt cometh in, he payeth Firſt-Fruits, and yet is not allowed to make his Benefit by Fines; which all Biſhop's Farmers are contented to do: So that he is caſt one whole Years Revenue behind-hand; and perhaps, hath no Power neither to make Leaſes in Twelve or Sixteen Years.</p>
               <p>This, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> will be a Cauſe to induce the <hi>Miniſters of the Word,</hi> not to ſeek Biſhopricks; whereby we may bring the Clergy both to Poverty and Contempt; from which they have ever been carefully defended, and provided for, even by the moſt antient Statutes and Laws of this Realm, now Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
               <p>Hurtful it is to their Servants; for this may be every Mans Caſe: We know, many good Gentlemens Sons ſerved Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and, How can they reward their long and faithful Service, but only by means of granting over of theſe Fines, or ſome other means out of the Spiritual Function? But this Act is good for the Courtier: But I muſt ſpeak no more of that.</p>
               <p>Laſtly; Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> my ſelf am Farmer to a Biſhop; and I ſpeak this, as in my own Caſe, (on my Knowledge) to the Houſe, that it is ordinary, upon every Grant after Four or Five Years, ever to Fine, and take a New Leaſe. But I refer it to the Conſideration of the Houſe, to do their Pleaſures therein: Only this I certifie, that I have the Copy of the Bill the laſt Parliament, exhibited to this Purpoſe; which I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving compared together with this preſent Bill, do find them to be word for word all one; and that was rejected: And ſo, I doubt not, if the Reaſons be well weighed, but this will have the like Succeſs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> ſaid; <hi>He thought it very fit, that the Bill ſhould be firſt Committed: For, talking with Sir</hi> Roger Maynwood <hi>in his Life-time, Lord Chief Baron of the</hi> Exchequer, <hi>he was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That it was more fit, and more ſafe for the Subjects Good, and far more eaſie for the Judges, that the Money ſhould be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court, and no Recognizance taken; which, if it might be committed, the Bill might be amended in that Point; and, no doubt,

               <p>For my part, I do not like this Conſtraining of Men to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, or uſe their Grounds at our Wills; but rather, let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man uſe his Ground to that which it is moſt fit for, and therein uſe his own Diſcretion. For Halſars, Cables, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and the like, we have plentifully enough from Forreign Nations; and we have divers Countries here in <hi>England</hi> make thereof in great abundance. And the Bill of Tillage may be a ſufficient Motive to us in this Caſe, not to take the Courſe that this Bill intendeth: For where the Law provideth, That every Man muſt Plow the third Part of his Land, I know it, divers poor People have done ſo, to avoyd the Penalty of the Statute; when their Abilities have been ſo poor, that they have not been able to buy Seed-Corn to Sow it withal; nay, they have been fain to hire others to Plow it: which, if it had been un-plowed, would have been good Paſture for Beaſts, or might have been converted to other good Uſes.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Upon this Motion, all the Houſe bad away with the Bill: But it was put to the Queſtion, <hi>Whether it ſhould be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or no?</hi> But becauſe of Doubt, the Houſe was divided,

            <p>This was one of the Proviſo's in the Bill For the Breeding, and againſt Stealing of Horſes, <hi>viz. That all Juſtices of Aſſize,</hi>

                     <hi>Bacons</hi> Speech for Repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Laws.</note>May it pleaſe you Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> not out of Oſtentation to this Houſe, but in Reverence I do ſpeak it: That I do much wonder to ſee the Houſe ſo continually divided, and to agree upon nothing; to ſee many Laws here, ſo well framed, and Offences provided againſt, and yet to have no better Succeſs and Entertainment. I do think every man in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, bound to help the Common-wealth the beſt he may; and better it is, to venture a mans Credit by Speaking, than to ſtretch a mans Conſcience by Silence, and to endeavor to make that good in Nature, which is poſſible in Effect.</p>
               <p>Laws be like Pills all gilt over, which if they be eaſily and well ſwallowed down, are neither bitter in digeſtion, nor hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the body; every man knows that Time is the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouler of Laws, and therefore there having been a great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Time, ſince the Repeal of a number of Laws; I know, and do aſſure my ſelf, there are many, more than I know, Laws both needleſs, and dangerous.</p>
               <p>I could therefore wiſh, that as uſually every Parliament, there is a Committee ſelected for the Continuance of divers Statutes, ſo the Houſe would be pleaſed alſo, that there might be a Committee for the Repeal of divers Statutes, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſuperfluous Branches of Statutes. And that every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Member of the Houſe, would give Information to the Committees, what Statutes, he thinketh fitting to be Repealed, or what Branch to be Superfluous, leſt, as he ſaid, <hi>pluat ſuper nos laqueas:</hi> The more Laws we make, the more Snares we lay to entrap our ſelves.</p>

An Act, That the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> may diſpoſe of his Lands, whereof he is Tenant in Tayle, as other Tenants in Tayle may do, by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, was read the firſt time; and the Pedigree here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſet down, was then produced to the Houſe.</p>

            <p>There was this day, a Page brought to the Bar,<note place="margin">A <hi>Page</hi> is brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Houſe.</hi>
               </note> for that Yeſter-day Sir <hi>Francis Hastings</hi> had cauſed him to be Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: For that as he went down the ſtairs, the Page offer'd to throng him. Whereupon he held him till the <hi>Speaker</hi> came out of the Houſe, who did commit him to the Serjeant's Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, till this day, to know the Pleaſure of the Houſe, what they would do therein. But this day, upon Sir <hi>Francis Hasting's</hi> intreaty, ſpeaking very earneſtly for him, and of his innocency, and unwillingneſs to do that Fact, as alſo upon the Pages Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion upon his Knees at the Bar, he was diſcharged. It was
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107812:91"/>moved, That becauſe his Hair was very Long, he might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a Barber, and cloſe cut before his Diſcharge. But that was thought very unfit, for the Gravity of the Houſe to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſo light a fault; ſo, after a ſharp and threatning Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, given him by the <hi>Speaker,</hi> he was Diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> moved the Houſe, That for as much as the antient Cuſtom of the Parliament had been, that not only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but their Servants ſhould be free from all Arreſts; yet notwithſtanding, a ſervant of Mr. <hi>William Cook,</hi> a member of this Houſe, was Arreſted by one <hi>Baker</hi> a Serjeant, at the ſuit of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon a Bond, in which indeed he is but Surety, as may appear unto you by this Letter (ſo the Letter was Read) the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents whereof was as aforeſaid, with this Clauſe in the end, <hi>From the moſt Loathſome, and the unfortunate Hole in the Priſon of</hi> Newgate, <hi>I humbly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Upon which Motion, as alſo upon Declaration of a Precedent in the 35 of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth: That the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> were Committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> for Arreſting <hi>George Ferrars</hi> a Member of this Houſe: It was generally agreed, That the Serjeant of this Houſe, ſhould be preſently ſent with his Mace for the ſaid Priſoner &amp; his Keeper; and alſo ſhould command the ſaid Baker, the Serjeant, and the procurater of the Arreſt, to attend the Court on <hi>Monday</hi> morning; ſo, after the Serjeant had been away about an hour and an half, he brought the Priſoner and his Keeper to the Bar, who Affirmed the whole matter as aforeſaid. And the Keeper was Commanded to deliver his Priſoner to the Serjeant, which he did, by taking him by the Hand, and ſo delivered his Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Serjeant. And the Houſe commanded the Keeper to take no Fees, and ſo the Priſoner was quite diſcharged.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>Robert Wroth</hi> moved to know, Whether Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> would Affirm that man to be his Servant, who ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>He was one of his moſt neceſſary Servants; for, in truth</hi> (quoth he) <hi>he is my Taylor.</hi> And thereupon the Serjeant was ſent for him as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>An Act, for the better Setling of Watches, was Read, and committed, and the Committees to meet at the midle <hi>Temple</hi>-Hall on <hi>Thurſday</hi> in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Henſhaw</hi> moved the Houſe, That the immediate Land-Lord of every ſuch Night-Walker, ſhould be bound for the good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of him to the Queens Uſe, which the Houſe would by no means hear of.</p>
            <p>An Act to avoid and prevent divers Lewd Miſdemeanors in baſe and idle Perſons, was Read and Committed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees in the Bill for Night-walkers, to meet on <hi>Thurſday</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noon, in the midle <hi>Temple</hi>-hall.</p>
            <p>An Act againſt Drunkards,<note place="margin">A Bill againſt going to an <hi>Ale-houſe,</hi> if within Two Miles of ones own Houſe.</note> and haunters of Ale-houſes, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect whereof is, <hi>That if any man do go to an Ale-houſe within two miles of his own Houſe, he ſhall Forfeit ſo much as he is in the Subſidy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Glaſcock</hi> ſpake to this Bill, and Informed the Houſe, <hi>That it was a common and uſual thing in</hi> Lancaſhire, <hi>and thoſe Parts, for Gentlemen as they go a Hawking, to go and take a Repast at an Ale-Houſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Glaſcock</hi> Oppoſes it.</note>

               <hi>Yea, men ſometimes of</hi> 500. <hi>Marks a Year: But, Mr.</hi> Speaker, <hi>I hope theſe men are not intended to come within this Bill. And for the Act it ſelf, I think it to be a meer Cob-web to catch poor Flies in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Francis Darcy</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Francis Darcy</hi> is for it.</note> 
               <hi>I think this Bill very fit to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd of, and Committed; for it tendeth to the Reſtraint of great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs uſually Committed, which we had need eſpecially to provide for, ſeeing ſuch continuall and great Proviſions both of Meat and Drink, go daily out of the Land, chiefly into</hi> Ireland,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Robert Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> 
               <hi>That (as an Honourable Perſon affirmed in this Houſe) we may feed an Army therewith, yea all the Realm, almoſt within the</hi> Engliſh Pale, <hi>and elſe where in other Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſides, in Reſtraining this great Exceſs, we ſhall do our Duties, and pleaſe God the more, who is jealous of his Honour, and will not ſuffer ſuch and ſo great a Sin to go unpuniſhed, neither in the Offenders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor in us that tolerate the ſame; but will lay his heavy hand of Wrath and Indignation upon this Land, which God avert and turn from us.</hi> So it was Committed, and the Committees appointed to meet on <hi>Fryday</hi> in the Afternoon, at the <hi>Middle-Temple</hi>-Hall.</p>
            <p>The Act touching Weights and Meaſures was read; which, upon divers Motions, was clearly expung'd the <hi>Houſe.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſhewed a great Imperfection in the Bill, becauſe there wanted a Remedy to meet with the Clerk of the Market. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, where a Puniſhment is inhaunc'd, and a ſpecial Privilege to gain greater Authority, it makes me doubt much of the good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: For, why ſhould he deſire to have</hi> Wales <hi>in, ſeeing he hath it in his Juriſdiction already. And, it is as ordinary as can be,</hi> Bring your Groat, <hi>(when he goeth a Circuiting)</hi> your Meaſure ſhall be Even.</p>
            <p>It was after put to the Queſtion for Committing; and ſome Twelve <hi>I, I, I;</hi> but not one for the Ingroſſing, but all ſaid <hi>No:</hi> So it was Rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Afternoon the ſame Day, at the Committee in the Houſe, touching the Subſidies:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> moved the Houſe to conſider,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Walt.

            <q>
               <p>I now only will intimate thus much unto you, That the Laſt <hi>Parliament</hi> only Three Subſidies were granted, upon fear that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were coming.

               <p>And, ſeeing the Sale of Her <hi>Majesties</hi> own Jewels, the great Loans her Subjects have lent her, yet unpaid: the continual Selling of her Lands, and decaying of her Revenues; the ſparing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107812:92"/>even out of her own Purſe, &amp; Apparrel for our ſakes, will not ſerve; but yet ſhe muſt be fain to call her Court of Parliament for our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Aid in this Caſe. I wiſh, for my own part, as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Member of this Common-Wealth, That we may not do leſs than we did before; and that we alſo would bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to our Eſtates, contribute to her Majeſties Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, as now they ſtand.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> Speech for Subſidies.</note> after a very diſcreet and judicious Speech made, touching Gods Protecting us for Religion-ſake, our peace and quietneſs, the ſafety of her Majeſties Perſon, the great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories we have had, the greatneſs of Neighbour-Princes, only raiſed by her Majeſty, ſo that ſhe hath ſpent, as was ſaid by Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> ſo much as that She is now fain to deſire the help of her Subjects:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Let us therefore, draw to ſome head, and leave our Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Speeches, fitter for a Parliament than a Committee; we are to conſider only, what is fit to be given: And for my own part, as a poor Member, and one of the meaneſt in this Houſe, I will be bold to deliver my Opinion firſt, becauſe ſome muſt break the Ice, <hi>Three Pound</hi> Land and under, to pay <hi>Two Shillings</hi> and <hi>Eight Pence</hi> in the Pound; <hi>Five Pounds</hi> Goods, and under, to pay <hi>One Shilling Eight Pence</hi> in the Pound, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Tenths</hi> and <hi>Fifteens,</hi> as ſoon as poſſible may be.</p>
               <p>And though I may ſeem over-bold, being but a Rural and Country man, to ſpeak even out of my own Element in this Caſe, yet I do heartily crave Pardon of all, beſeeching that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my unaptneſs, nor diſorder of Speech, nor the unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Perſon, may prejudice the Cauſe.</p>

As long as the Queen, by Advice of her Council, did find means to ſpare you, ſo long ſhe ever deſired her Subjects might not be Charged. But if her Majeſty, as ſoon as the laſt Subſidy had been ſpent, ſhould
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107812:92"/>have again reſorted unto you, I do aſſure you this Parliament had been called in <hi>October</hi> laſt.</p>
               <p>Now, if upon the Providence and Foreſight of a growing Sore, you did Contribute unto her Majeſty, much more now, ſhould we do the ſame; ſeeing a Reſolute company of <hi>Spaniards</hi> have Intrenched themſelves in Her Majeſties Kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and more Supplies thither are daily Expected. It is time that we open our Coffers, that we may obviate in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe few Forces of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> leſt growing to greater Forces, we cannot expell them with <hi>Five Hundred,</hi> which we may now do with <hi>One Hundred</hi> at preſent.</p>
               <p>If any that ſit next the Door, be deſirous to ſit next the Chair, to give his Opinon, I will not only give him my Place, but thank him to take my Charge. [This was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be ſpoken of Sir <hi>Edward Hobby,</hi> who coming to ſit near the Chair, and none giving him place, ſate next the Door] We that ſit here, take your Favours out of Courteſy, not out of Duty. But to the purpoſe:</p>
               <p>The Queen hath occaſion to uſe (as divers in this Houſe do know) <hi>Three Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> before <hi>Eaſter:</hi> How this ſhall be Raiſed and Gathered, That is the Queſtion. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this proportion of Charge, neither can the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be repelled, nor the War there maintain'd: Neither Her Majeſties other Affairs be ſet on Foot: Neither Proviſion ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient can be made for defence againſt Forreign Invaſions.</p>
               <p>Admit with a leſs Charge we ſhould now Expell him; Will any man be ſo ſimple to think he will give over the Enterpriſe, being of ſo great Conſequence, and grow Deſperate? I ſhould think him a man but of a ſhallow Underſtanding, and leſs Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. Surely, if we had been of that mind, when he had that great Overthrow of his Invincible Navy, <hi>One Thouſand Five Hundred Eighty Eight,</hi> we had been deſtinated unto Perdition. For, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chargeable Enterpriſes, of Puiſſant &amp; great Conſequence hath he ſince made? The like, if his Forces in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould now Fail, would he do again.</p>
               <p>And therefore, That we now do in Defence, if he ſhould be expelled with a leſs Matter, would as well ſerve to make De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt his next Invaſion of that Kingdom; as alſo, to Enrich her Majeſty, to be ready to Furniſh her Navy and Forces the ſpeedier for her ſafety. Beſides, if he beſtows ſo vaſt a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the gaining of one poor Town, <hi>Oſtend;</hi> what will he do to gain ſo ſtrong and Famous a Kingdom as <hi>Ireland?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will, by the Leave of a VVorthy Perſon that ſits by me, and knows theſe things better than I do, yeild a particular Account to you of the State it ſelf. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The laſt whole Subſidy after the Rate of <hi>Four Shillings</hi> Land, and <hi>Eight Groats</hi> Goods, came not to above <hi>Eighty-Thouſand Pounds;</hi> the Subſidy of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, <hi>Twenty-Thouſand Pounds;</hi> the Double Fifteens, <hi>Sixty-Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds:</hi> In all, <hi>One-Hundred</hi> and <hi>Sixty-Thouſand Pounds.</hi>

            <q>
               <p>May it pleaſe you, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was well ſaid by a Worthy Member of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> (Mr. <hi>Francis Bacon</hi>) <hi>That every Man is bound to help the Common-Wealth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107812:93"/>the best he may:</hi> Much more is every Man, in his own Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bound, being a Member of this Houſe, if he knows any dangerous Enormity towards the Common-Wealth; That he would not only open it, but if it may be, ſuppreſs it.</p>
               <p>We being all here within theſe Walls together, may be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to a <hi>Jury,</hi> ſhut up in a Chamber: Every Man <hi>There</hi> upon his Oath, and every Man <hi>Here</hi> upon his Conſcience; being the Grand <hi>Jury-Men</hi> of this Land, bound to deal both Plainly and Truly. Here-with (though a moſt unworthy, and leaſt ſufficient Member of this <hi>Houſe</hi>) my Self being touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I had rather adventure my Credit by Speaking, (though confuſedly) knowing the great Inconvenience and Miſchief at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this Kingdom by Silence, in ſo pleaſing a Caſe, as I perſwade my ſelf, this Bill will be to every Man that hears it.</p>
               <p>To which, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> becauſe I may have Benefit of Speech, if occaſion ſerves, at the ſecond Reading thereof, I will not ſpeak more at this preſent, than only touch the Tract of the Bill it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Honourable Perſon that in the <hi>Upper-Houſe,</hi> in the Beginning of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſpake againſt the Lewd Abuſes of Prowling Sollicitors, and their great Multitude; who ſet Diſſention between Man and Man, like a Snake cut in pieces, crawl together, and joine themſelves again, to ſtir up even Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Diſſention: He, I ſay, adviſes us, that a Law might be made to ſuppreſs them.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved, that no Man this <hi>Parliament,</hi> ever profer'd to prefer any ſuch Bill to this <hi>Houſe;</hi> but ſure I am, no Man ſpake to this Purpoſe. I have therefore, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of my young Experience, becauſe I know part of their Abuſes, and with that ſmall Portion of Learning that I have, to draw a Bill; and here it is. The Title is thus, <hi>An Act to Suppreſs the Multitude of Common Sollicitors.</hi> The Body of the Act diſableth all Perſons to Sollicite in any Cauſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their own. There is Excepted, and Fore-prized, Four ſeveral ſorts; <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Atturnies,</hi> in their own Courts where they be Sworn: <hi>Servants in Livery,</hi> and <hi>Kinſmen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Fourth Degree of Conſanguinity.</hi> And no Man within this Kingdom, but may find a ſufficient Sollicitor within theſe Four Degrees.

            <q>
               <p>VVhen it was the good Pleaſure of the Houſe, to give Order to the Committees to conſider the common danger of the Realm; in which not only every Member of this Houſe, but every Man in the Kingdom, is Intereſſed: It liked the Committees, after their reſolution to chooſe one amongſt all, to give an Account of their Proceedings; and that is my ſelf.</p>
               <p>I do know it were the ſafeſt way for a mans memory, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the laſt Reſolution,<note place="margin">Reports to the whole Houſe, what was Cone at the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee.</note> without any precedent Argument; for rare is the Aſſembly, in which there is not ſome variety of Opinions. I need not recite the Form of the Committee, by reaſon of ſo good Attendance, being little inferior to our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at this preſent: yet if it be true, that, <hi>Forma</hi> doth <hi>dare eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiam,</hi> it will be ſomewhat neceſſary for me to deliver the manner of our Proceeding, and the Circumſtance, rather than hazard the Interpretation of ſuch a Reſolution.</p>
               <p>The Day was <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, the Place this <hi>Houſe,</hi> the Time about four houres: And I am of Opinion, That if we had all agreed upon the manner, as we did ſpeedily upon the matter, all had been diſpatched in an hour. It ſeemed, by the ready Conſent of the Committee, That they came not one to look on another, like Sheep, one to accompany another; but the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was Debated by ſome, and at laſt Conſented unto by all.</p>
               <p>Our Contention bred Difference, our Difference cauſe of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, both how to eaſe the State, and make this Subſidy leſs burthenſome, which ſhall be recited.</p>
               <p>Some were of Opinion, that the <hi>Three Pound</hi> Men ſhould be ſpared, becauſe it was to be conſider'd, they had but ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and they did give almoſt <hi>Secundum ſanguinem.</hi> Others were of Opinion, that the <hi>Four Pound</hi> men ſhould give double, and the reſt upward ſhould be higher Ceſſed. Others vvere of other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>Again it was moved, Whether this Subſidy ſhould go in the name of a Benevolence, or Contribution? Or whether in the Name of a Fourth Subſidy, but vvas ſaid to be ſubject to great Miſtaking, becauſe it vvould be ſaid to be a great Innovation.</p>
               <p>But at laſt, moſt Voices Reſolved, It ſhould have the old Name of a Subſidy, becauſe <hi>Subſidium</hi> and <hi>Auxilium</hi> are all one. The moſt Voices Concluded, There ſhould be no Exception of the <hi>Three Pound</hi> men, becauſe according to their Rate, ſome vvere Aſſeſſed under value; beſides, ſeparation might breed Emulation, Suſpition of Partiality and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>The Time vvas Reſolved upon, and that in reſpect of Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be by the <hi>Firſt</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and the vvhole Realm, when each man comes into his Country, will be better ſatisfied, when they ſhall know vve have ſpared no man, nor made no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:107812:94"/>
               <p>It vvas ſaid, by a Member of this Houſe, (Sir <hi>Francis Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>) That he knew ſome poor People Pawn their <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>Pans,</hi> to pay the Subſidy.</p>
               <p>It may be, you dwell vvhere you ſee and hear. I dwell where I hear and believe. And this I know, That neither <hi>Pots</hi> nor <hi>Pans,</hi> nor <hi>Diſh</hi> nor <hi>Spoon,</hi> ſhould be ſpared, when Danger is at our El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes. But he that ſpake this, in my Conſcience ſpake not to hinder the Subſidy, or the greatneſs of our Guift, but to ſhew the Poverty of ſome Aſſeſſed, and by ſparing others. But by no means, I would have the <hi>Three Pound</hi> men Exempted, becauſe I would have the King of <hi>Spain</hi> know, how willing we are to ſell all in Defence of Gods Religion, our Prince and Country. I have read, when <hi>Hannibal</hi> reſolved to ſack <hi>Rome,</hi> he dwelt in the Cities Adjoyning, and never feared or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his Enterprize, until word was brought him, That the Maidens, Ladies, and VVidows of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſold their Ear-rings, Jewels, and all their Neceſſaries, to maintain War againſt him.</p>
               <p>I do take my ſelf in Duty bound, to acquaint this <hi>Houſe</hi> with the Modeſty of the Committee, at the Propoſition; That when firſt this <hi>Houſe</hi> never ſtuck to Commit, they never ſtuck in underſtanding the Reaſons to grant it. And I do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, that the <hi>Bonus Genius</hi> of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> did not wiſh a more Reſolved Unity, than we had Unity in Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And of this Great Committee, it may be ſaid, <hi>De Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joribus Principes Conſultant, De minoribus omnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, by your Commandments, I have undergone this Charge; and will be ready to do the like Duty, whenſoever you ſhall command me.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then, after Conſultation of the great Occaſions,<note place="margin">The Subſidy put to the Queſtion, and voted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> it was put to the Queſtion. <hi>Whether the double Tenths and Fifteens, ſhould be Paid by the Firſt of</hi> February, <hi>and the Subſidy by the laſt of</hi> Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, <hi>viz. for this Fourth Subſidy, before the Third began: And that the First Payment of the Firſt Three Subſidies, ſhould be brought in by the Tenth of</hi> June <hi>viz. half a Subſidy?</hi> And all ſaid, <hi>Yea;</hi> and not one, <hi>No.</hi>

            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> asked the Houſe, <hi>If they would appoint Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees to draw the Bill?</hi> So they appointed the Queens Council, and all the Serjeants at Law of the Houſe, and no more.</p>

            <q>
               <p>But at length, Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid, I am willing to ſpeak, in two Reſpects; the One, touching the Bill it ſelf; the Other, touching the Controverſie in the <hi>Houſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſpeaks to it.</note> about the Commitment.</p>
               <p>Touching the Bill, I dare not upon my own Judgment, be ſo venturous or bold, to Reject this Bill, unleſs firſt it might have a Commitment. For, the Wiſdom of that Time, when it was firſt Inſtituted, was ſo apt to look into Imperfections, that doubtleſs, if any Inconvenience had been but eſpyed, they would ſtraight have avoided it.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:107812:97"/>
               <p>Therefore, in my Opinion, it is not fit for us to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Actions of former Ages, but upon mature and adviſed Deliberation. I do therefore greatly commend the Wiſdom of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> in Committing of this Bill, and others of the like Nature and Conſequence, before we Reject them.</p>
               <p>For the other Part, Though it be a Rule in the <hi>Houſe, That thoſe againſt the Bill ſhould be no Committees;</hi> yet in a Caſe of ſo great Conſequence, and ſo greatly touching the State of the City of <hi>London,</hi> there is no Reaſon, but they may have their particular Voices, as Committees, as well as any Member of this <hi>Houſe:</hi> Neither have we any Reaſon to Exclude them, more than any other; eſpecially they being Choſen for the moſt Principal City of this Kingdom; which is the Chamber of Her <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty:</hi> whom we ſhould the rather reſpect, for Her <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſake; who doth, and will remember their Loyalty and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſhewed unto Her in the late dangerous Action, (<hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>his Riſing</hi>): For which, if ever <hi>Prince</hi> had Cauſe of Thankfulneſs to Her Subjects, doubtleſs Her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaſty</hi> is to confeſs as much.</p>
               <p>In my Opinion therefore, we ſhould do great Wrong, and purchaſe them great Blame at their Hands that ſent them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Truſt, if in a Matter of this Conſequence, and ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly touching the State of this City, we ſhould not admit them as Committees.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> replies.</note> That by Committing of a Bill, the <hi>Houſe</hi> allowed of the Body thereof, though they diſallowed of ſome Imperfections in the ſame. And therefore, committed it to ſome choſen Men in Truſt, to Reform and Amend any thing therein, which they found Imperfect.</p>
               <p>And it is preſumed, That he that will give his <hi>No</hi> to the Committing of a Bill, at the Commitment will be wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Bill. And therefore, the <hi>Houſe</hi> allowing of this Bill to be Committed, are, in my Opinion, to diſallow any that will be againſt the Body of the Bill, for being Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I will propound the firſt Queſtion: All that will have a man, that hath been againſt the Body of the Bill to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, let them ſhew their Opinions by ſaying</hi> Yea.

It was well Obſerved by an ancient Member of this Houſe, who is now with <hi>God,</hi> that no Conference with the Lords touching a Subſidy, ſhould be had; yet that Rule hath been altered in late Parliaments, by reaſon of ſpecial Cauſes: So I do think it would be more Honour to this Houſe to direct a Warrant to the Lord-Keeper, than to an Inferiour Miniſter of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</hi>

And Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> certified the Houſe, <hi>That to his knowledge, the Queen was well pleaſed with this Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were returned Burgeſſes for <hi>Newton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Langton</hi> of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Richard Aſhton,</hi> who was preſent in the Houſe; but the ſaid Baron, though he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, he was not yet come to Town, by reaſon he fell Sick by the way, as Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> informed the Houſe. But he ſent up his Solicitor hither, to follow his Cauſes in Law, and to pay a certain Debt of his, to Mr. <hi>John Lacy</hi> of <hi>Cheapſide.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> informed the Houſe,<note place="margin">A Complaint of an Arreſt of a Solicitor belonging to a Member that was not yet Sworn.</note> 
               <q rend="inline">That this Solicitor was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted on <hi>Sunday</hi> Night laſt, in <hi>Grays-Inn-Lane,</hi> by a Bill of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> at the Suit of one <hi>William Musket</hi> a Taylor, and carried Priſoner to <hi>Newgate.</hi> And there, after a diſcharge got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, becauſe he ſaid he was a Servant to a Parliament Man; he was no ſooner diſcharged, but he was ſtrait again Arreſted, and carried to the <hi>Compter,</hi> and there laid all Night, until he ſent to the <hi>Serjeant at Armes,</hi> who fetched him out, and kept him in his Cuſtody.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And now this Day at the Bar, he deſired the privilege of the Houſe, he being a ſpecial Servant to a Member thereof:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> makes a Doubt, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could have Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</note> ſo after, he was removed out.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Francis Moore</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">I think it will grow a Queſtion, Whether he ſhall have privilege, in that his Maſter is not Sworn, nor here.</q>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> pleads, he had, as all others, <hi>Fourteen</hi> days, before the Meeting or Swearing of the <hi>Houſe.</hi> Where <hi>Note, The Members then claimed but Fourteen Days before a Seſſion, which is now reck'ned Forty Dayes.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">Every Parliament-Man hath privilege for himſelf and Servants Fourteen Days before the Parliament, and this is, before he is returned or Sworn; much more ought we to give privilege in this Caſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then was <hi>Musket,</hi> that procured the Arreſt, brought in; and being demanded the Reaſon, How he durſt meddle with any Mans Servant of the Houſe? he Anſwered, <q rend="inline">That the ſaid So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciter, being demanded whether he Served any Parliament-Man? He Anſwered, <hi>No.</hi> Which indeed afterwards proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, when they were brought Face to Face.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Serjeant was brought in, who ſaid, <hi>He was put to his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107812:107"/>Choice, Whether he would tarry ſtill at</hi> Newgate, <hi>or go to the</hi> Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Being further asked, <hi>Whether he could ſay any more in his own Excuſe?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>No.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Solicitor was brought in; who juſtified, that he was firſt Arreſted, and after Diſcharged, and then the ſecond time Arreſted as aforeſaid. So they were both removed out of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> took hold of the Speech made by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, of his Choice to ſtay in <hi>Newgate,</hi> or to go to the <hi>Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> as alſo, that he was doubly Arreſted, and paid double Fees.</p>
            <p>So after Conſultation had, it was put to the Queſtion, and agreed by the Houſe, That they both ſhould pay the Solicitors Coſt and Damages, and be impriſoned three days in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants Cuſtody. And each of them, both <hi>Musket,</hi> and the Serjeant, to Pay the Serjeant Attending this Houſe his Fees, and the Solicitor to Pay none, and ſo to be Diſcharged.</p>

               </note> Anſwered, <hi>That he now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Weightineſs of divers Buſineſſes that were now in hand: The Conſultation which we were likely preſently to have touching the Bill of Subſidy. That the Enemy, the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>was Landed in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>and the buſineſs, of thoſe Affairs of great Imports: as alſo his own Buſineſs in the Upper-Houſe, and the ſhort end which was like to be of this Parliament. And therefore, he would now not ſtand to make Contention, or ſhew his further Reaſons; but prayed us, to certify you all, That he would be moſt ready and willing, to perform the deſire of this Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill of Petty-Theft, and Patents aforeſaid, were ſent up to the Lords, by Sir <hi>John Forteſcue</hi> and Mr. <hi>Secretary Hubbart.</hi> The Houſe called upon Mr. <hi>Secretary</hi> to go, but he deſired to be excuſed, becauſe he was troubled with a Cold.</p>
            <p>A Bill to reſtrain the Tranſportation of Money out of the Realm,<note place="margin">A Bill to prevent Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporting of <hi>Bulloin.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fettyplace</hi> a Burgeſs for <hi>London,</hi> ſpake to this Bill, and ſaid,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Fetty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place</hi> ſpeaks to that Bill.</note> 
               <hi>It is to be thought that the</hi> Netherlander <hi>having ſo much uſe for Money, is the Exporter thereof out of this Realm. The</hi> French <hi>King made it a Law, That no man on pain of Death, ſhould Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Money thence.</hi> Germany <hi>holdeth the</hi> Standard, <hi>ſo doth</hi> France, <hi>and ſo do We. But the</hi> Netherlander <hi>only doth not, and he only thereby gained of all Three. There be good Statutes already made to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107812:107"/>this purpoſe, both in the time of</hi> Rich. 2. Hen. 3. Hen. 4. Hen. 5. <hi>and</hi> Hen. 6. <hi>That no Stranger ſhould bring Commodities into this Land, but he ſhould bring in ſo much Money,</hi> &amp;c. He made a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long Speech touching the manner of Trade by Exchange, in Merchants Language, which I could not well Note. So the Bill was committed, and the <hi>Chequer-Chamber</hi> appointed the place, and <hi>Friday</hi> in the afternoon the Time.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Henry Mountague</hi> ſhewed, <hi>That</hi> 17. Ed. 4.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> for the Bill.</note> 
               <hi>ſuch Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation was made Felony, and never ſince Tranſportation much heard of, till this Queens Days; in whoſe time, none of thoſe Laws are in force, which if they were revived, and ſet on Foot again, I think ſuch kind of Tranſportation would be leſs uſed than it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the Burgeſſes of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Moved, <hi>All Officers of Ports might be certified of ſuch Goods as be Exported, and the Skipper bound in Bond, to be ſent to her Majeſties</hi> Cuſtom Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> ſaid, "<hi>Mr.</hi> Speaker,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Davies</hi> about Money and Barture in Trade.</note> I hold this Paradox for a true ground of Policy, <hi>That if there were no Money in the World, then this Kingdom were the happieſt Nation in the World. And the beſt Age was, when there was only bartering of Commodities; For one yard of Cloath would be better than three yards of Velvet. And an Ounce of Iron, for the Uſe of man, better than a Pound of Gold. A Buſhel of Corn, better than ten Buſhels of Pepper or other Grain. The fundamental Cauſe of this Bill was, That we might not be Cozened of our Moneys, who have the best</hi> Standard <hi>in the World: For now the</hi> Exchange <hi>is Governd by</hi> Brokers; <hi>and as it pleaſes them, the</hi> Exchange <hi>muſt Riſe and Fall.</hi> So the Bill was Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>Francis Darcy</hi> brought this Bill in after Commitment, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Me thought I heard a ſtrange Voice at the Committing of this Bill.

               </p>
               <p>This Bill may touch the Prerogative Royal; which, as I learned the Laſt <hi>Parliament,</hi> is ſo Tranſcendant, that the Eye of the Subject may not Aſpire thereunto. Far be it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from me, that the State, and Prerogative-Royal of the <hi>Prince</hi> ſhould be tyed by me, or the Act of any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us conſider the word <hi>Monopoly,</hi> what it is; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> is <hi>Unus,</hi> and <hi>Polis, Civitas:</hi> So then, the Meaning of the Word is; <hi>A Reſtraint of any thing Publick, in a City, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to a Private Uſe.</hi> And the <hi>Uſer</hi> called a <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan; quaſi, cujus privatum lucrum eſt urbis, &amp; orbis Commune Malum.</hi> And we may well term this Man, <hi>The Whirlpool of the Princes Profits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every Man hath Three eſpecial Friends, his <hi>Goods,</hi> his <hi>Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and his <hi>Good Name:</hi> Theſe Men may have the Two Firſt, but not the Laſt. If I were acquainted with any of them, I would wiſh them to loſe ſome Goods, to gain a Good Name. They are <hi>Inſidioſa, quia dulcia:</hi> They are <hi>doloſa, quia dubia.</hi> I ſpeak not, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> either Repining at her <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's</hi> Prerogative, or miſliking the Reaſons of her Grants; but out of Grief of Heart, to ſee the Town wherein I Serve, peſtered, and continually vexed with the Subſtitutes, or Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents of theſe <hi>Monopolitans;</hi> who are ever ill diſpoſed, and ill affected Members.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, give me Leave to prove this unto you by this Argument; Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth the Royal Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> being granted upon good and profitable Suggeſtions, and alſo abuſeth the Authority and Warrant of Her <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Privy-Councel, being granted unto him for the more Favourable Execution of his Patent; this Man is an evil diſpoſed, and dangerous Subject. But that this is true, and hath been done by one Perſon, a Subſtitute of a Patentee, I will prove unto you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> needs not be proved, the <hi>Minor</hi> I will thus prove: My ſelf am <hi>Occulatus Teſtis</hi> of this <hi>Minor; Et talis teſtis plus va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let exiſtens unus, quam auriti decem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Subſtitutes of the Patentees for <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi> came not long ſince to the Town where I Serve; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107812:109"/>ſtaid Sale of both theſe Commodities; unleſs the Sellers would compound with them, they muſt preſently to Councel-Table. My ſelf, though Ignorant, yet not ſo Unskilful, by reaſon of my Profeſſion, viewed their Patent, to ſee whether their Proceedings were according to their Authority, and found they exceeded it in Three Points. For, where the Patent gives <hi>Six</hi> Months Liberty to the Subject that hath any <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> to ſell the ſame, this Perſon comes down within <hi>Two</hi> Months, and takes Bond of them to his own Uſe; where he ought to bring them before a Juſtice of Peace, and they there be bound in Recognizance; and after, to be returned into the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> And ſo, by Uſurpation, retaineth Power in his own Hands, both to Kill and Save. Thus Her <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Commiſſion being tranſgreſſed, both in Zeal, as a Subject, and Sworn-Servant to Her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> I hold my ſelf bound in Duty, to certifie the <hi>Houſe</hi> thereof. And alſo, this Subſtitute ſtands Indicted, as an Obſtinate <hi>Recuſant:</hi> Yea, when Her <hi>Majeſtys</hi> Name hath been ſpoken of, and Her Self prayed for, he hath refuſed to ſtir Hat or Lip.</p>
               <p>My humble Motion therefore is, That we may uſe ſome Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Circumſpective Care, to prevent this enſuing Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> ſaid: The <hi>Gentleman</hi> that laſt ſpake,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> to the ſame Bill, againſt it.</note> toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>against</hi> the Bill, that for my own Part, not well hearing him, I did not well underſtand him. I confeſs the Bill, as it is, is but in few Words; but yet Ponderous and Weighty.</p>
               <p>For the Prerogative-Royal of the <hi>Prince:</hi> For my own Part, I ever allowed of it; and it is ſuch, as I hope I ſhall never ſee diſcuſſed. The <hi>Queen,</hi> as She is our Sovereign, hath both an Inlarging and Reſtraining Liberty of Her Prerogative; that is, She hath Power by Her Patents, to ſet at liberty Things reſtrained, by Statute-Law, or otherwiſe: And by Her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, She may reſtrain Things that are at Liberty.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>First:</hi> She may grant <hi>non Obſtantes,</hi> contrary to the Penal Laws; which truly, in my own Conſcience, are as hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Subject, as <hi>Monopolies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Second:</hi> If any Man, out of his own Wit, Induſtry, or Endeavour, find out any thing Beneficial for the Common-Wealth, or bring any New Invention, which every Subject of this Realm may uſe; yet in regard of his Pains, Travel and Charge therein, Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> is pleaſed (perhaps) to grant him a Privilege, to uſe the ſame only by himſelf, or his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, for a certain time: This is one kind of <hi>Monopoly.</hi> Sometimes, there is a Glut of Things, when they be in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Quantities, as of Corn; and perhaps, Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> gives Licenſe to one Man, of Tranſportation: This is another kind of <hi>Monopoly.</hi> Sometimes there is a Scarcity, or ſmall Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; and the like is granted alſo.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:107812:110"/>
               <p>Theſe, and divers of this Nature, have been in Tryal, both in the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> upon Actions of Treſpaſs; where, if the Judges do find the Privilege good for the Common-Wealth, they will Allow it, otherwiſe Diſallow it. And alſo, I know, That Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> Her ſelf, hath given command to her <hi>Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General,</hi> to bring divers of them (ſince the Laſt <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) to Tryal in the <hi>Exchecquer.</hi> Since which, <hi>Fifteen</hi> or <hi>Sixteen,</hi> to my Knowledge, have been Repealed: Some upon Her <hi>Majeſty's</hi> own Expreſs Command, upon Complaint made unto Her by Petition; and ſome by <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> in the <hi>Exchec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Mr. <hi>Speaker, (ſaid he, pointing to the Bill)</hi> This is no Stranger in this Place; but a Stranger in this Veſtment. The Uſe hath been ever, by Petition to Humble our ſelves to Her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and by Petition to deſire to have our Grievances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed; eſpecially, when the Remedy toucheth Her ſo nigh in Prerogative. All cannot be done at once; neither was it poſſible, ſince the Laſt <hi>Parliament,</hi> to repeal All. If Her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> makes a Patent, or a Monopoly, to any of Her Servants; That we muſt go and cry out againſt: But if She grants it to a Number of Burgeſſes, or Corporation, that muſt ſtand; and that, forſooth, is no <hi>Monopoly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, and I ſay again, That we ought not to deal or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with, or judge of Her <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Prerogative. I wiſh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man therefore, to be careful in this Point: And humbly pray this <hi>Houſe,</hi> to teſtifie with me, That I have diſcharged my Duty, in reſpect of my Place, in ſpeaking on Her <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's</hi> Behalf; and do proteſt, I have delivered my Conſcience, in ſaying what I have ſaid.</p>

                  </note> He that will go about to debate Her <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Prerogative Royal, muſt walk warily. In reſpect of a Grievance out of that City for which I Serve, I think my ſelf bound to ſpeak That now, which I had not intended to ſpeak before: I mean, a <hi>Monopoly of Salt.</hi> It is an Old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Sal ſapit omnia: Fire</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> are not more Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

                  <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Wal. Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> Bluſhes.</note> (<hi>At which word Sir</hi> Walter Rawleigh <hi>Bluſh'd</hi>) <hi>Dice, Starch,</hi> &amp;c. they are, (becauſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies</hi>) I muſt confeſs, very Hateful, though not ſo Hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I know, there is a great Difference in them: And I think, if the Abuſe in this <hi>Monopoly of Salt</hi> were Particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, this would walk in the Fore-Rank.</p>
               <p>Now, ſeeing we are come to the Means of Redreſs, let us ſee it be ſo Mannerly and Handſomely handled, that after a Commitment, it may have good Paſſage.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:107812:110"/>of Her <hi>Majesty's</hi> Prerogative Royal, and the State. But becauſe ye ſhall know this Courſe is no new Invention, but long ſince digeſted in the Dayes of our Fore-Fathers, above <hi>Three Hundred</hi> Years ago; I will offer to your Conſiderations, one Precedent in the 50 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. At which time, one <hi>John Peache</hi> was Arreigned at this Bar, for that he had obtained of the <hi>King</hi> a <hi>Monopoly</hi> for Sweet <hi>Wines:</hi> The Patent, after great Advice and Diſpute, adjudged Voyd; and before his Face, in open <hi>Parliament,</hi> Cancell'd; becauſe he had Exacted <hi>Three Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> and <hi>Four Pence,</hi> upon every Tun of <hi>Wine:</hi> himſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to Priſon, until he had made Reſtitution of all that he ever had Received; and not to be Delivered, till after a Fine of <hi>Five Hundred</hi> Pounds paid to the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Precedent worthy Obſervation;<note place="margin">A notable Precedent.</note> but I dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, worthy the Following. And, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> as I think it no Derogation to the Omnipotency of <hi>God,</hi> to ſay, He can do ill; ſo I think it no Derogation to the Perſon or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the <hi>Queen,</hi> to ſay ſo: Yet, becauſe Two Eyes may ſee more than One, I humbly pray, That there may be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment had of this Bill, leſt ſome thing may be therein, which may prove the Bane and Overthrow thereof, at the Time of the Paſſing.</p>

               <hi>If we proceed by way of Petition, we can have no more gratious Anſwer, than we had the laſt Parliament to our Petitions. Since the Parliament, we have had no Reformation. And the Reaſon why I think no Reformation hath been had, is, becauſe I never heard the Cries against</hi> Monopolies <hi>greater, and more vehement.</hi>

            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> ſaid: <hi>A Gentleman, a Good Member of this Houſe,</hi> (<hi>Sir</hi> John Gray) <hi>was Served with a</hi> Subpoena <hi>in</hi> Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Ad Reſpondendum 30 Nov. ad ſectam Roberti Atkins. <hi>If no Order be taken herein, I think for my own Part, both the</hi> Houſe, <hi>and the Privileges thereof, will grow in Contempt.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Zacharias Locke</hi> ſaid: <hi>Mr.</hi> Speaker, <hi>I am not againſt this Bill, it is a Commendable piece of Work; but, Mr.</hi> Speaker, <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Bill yeildeth too great ſcope of Fiſhing into the Sea; which how Prejudiciall it may be to the Office of the Lord</hi> Admiral, <hi>or to his Succeſſors, or to the Royalty of any other, I know not; therefore, That the Bill may have the ſafer Paſſage, I wiſh it may be Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of at a Commitment.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">I did rather yeildingly accept, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly imbrace this labour impoſed upon me. I Wiſh the Councel may be heard, becauſe we ſhall have the more time of conſideration, what to do.

This Patent was granted to Sir <hi>Thomas Wilks,</hi> and after to one <hi>Smith.</hi> To <hi>Lynn</hi> there is every year brought at leaſt Three Thouſand weight of Salt: and every weight, ſince this Patent, is inhanced Twenty ſhillings; and where the Buſhel was wont to be Eight pence, it is now Sixteen pence. And, I dare boldly ſay it, if this Patent were called in, there might well be Three Thouſand Pounds a year ſaved in the Ports of <hi>Lynn, Boſton,</hi> and <hi>Hull.</hi> I ſpeak this of white Salt.</p>

               <q rend="inline">The Bill is very injurious, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: Injurious, in that it taketh, or rather ſweepeth away her Majeſties Prerogative; and Ridiculous, in that there is a Proviſo, That this Statute ſhall not extend to Grants made to Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That is a gull to ſweeten the Bill withall, it is only to make Fools Fond. All men of the Law know, that a Bill which is only Expoſitory to Expound the Common-Law, doth Enact nothing, neither is any <hi>Proviſo</hi> good therein. And therefore the Statute of 34. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. of Wills, (which is but an Act expoſitory of the Statute of 32. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. of Wills) touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sir <hi>John Bonfords</hi> Will, was adjudged void.

But now, we might hope, that by the ſending of our Speaker, preſently after ſuch a Committee, and Speech made, with humble Suit, not only to Repeal all Monopolies Grievous to the Subject; but alſo, that it would pleaſe Her Majeſty to give us leave to make an Act, that they might be of no more force, validity or Effect, than they are at the Common Law, without the ſtrength of her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative: which though we might now do, and the Act being ſo reaſonable, we did aſſure our ſelves Her Majeſty would not deny the paſſing thereof; yet we her Majeſties Loyal and Loving Subjects, would not offer without Her Privity or Conſent, (the Cauſe ſo nearly touching Her Prerogative) or go about the doing of any ſuch Act. And alſo, that at the Committee, which ſhould make this Speech, every Member of this Houſe, which either found Himſelf, his Town, or Country grieved, might put in, in fair Writeing, ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and <hi>Monopolies</hi> as he would juſtify to be true.

            <p>Of <hi>Starch:</hi> Where other Countries have heretofore ſpent their Corn and Fuel in making of it, and we had it then at <hi>Eighteen Shillings</hi> a Hundred Weight, and Her Majeſty Received great Cuſtom thereby; now do we ſpend Corn and Fuel extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in making thereof, which might well be ſpared, and it is now at <hi>Fifty</hi> and <hi>Fifty Six Shillings</hi> a <hi>Hundred;</hi> and her Majeſty hath great loſs of her Cuſtomes, by making it within the Realm.</p>

Juſtice, <hi>in reſpect he can do no Wrong: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Law is,</hi> 1 Hen. 7. That the <hi>King</hi> cannot commit a Diſſeiſin. Mercy, <hi>in reſpect he giveth Leave to his Subjects, to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107812:115"/>Right themſelves by Law. And therefore, in the</hi> 44 Aſſ. <hi>an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment was brought againſt</hi> Bakers <hi>and</hi> Brewers; <hi>for that, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Licenſe, they had broken the Aſſize: Wherefore, according to that Precedent, I think it moſt fit to Proceed by Bill, and not by Petition.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> againſt the Bill.</note> If there had not been ſome Miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Confuſion in the Committee, I would not have now ſpoken. The Queſtion was, <hi>Of the most convenient Way to Reform theſe Grievances of</hi> Monopolies. But, after Diſputation of that Labour, we have not Received the expected Fruit.</p>
               <p>If every Man ſhould take Leave to Speak for the Common Subject, I am afraid, in theſe vaſt Powers of our Minds, we ſhall Diſpute the Project and Reformation quite out of Doors.</p>
               <p>This Diſpute draws Two great Things in queſtion: <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Prince's</hi> Power. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Freedom of <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men. I am Born an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Man, and a Fellow-Member of this <hi>Houſe;</hi> I would deſire to Live no Day, in which I ſhould Detract from Either.</p>
               <p>I am Servant to the <hi>Queen;</hi> and before I would ſpeak, or give my conſent to a Caſe that ſhould debaſe Her Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or abridge it, I would wiſh my Tongue cut out of my Head. I am ſure there were Law-Makers, before there were Laws.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Gentleman</hi> went about to poſſeſs Us with the Execution of the Law, in an Antient Record of 50 <hi>Edvardi</hi> 3. Likely enough to be True in that Time, when the <hi>King</hi> was afraid of the <hi>Subject.</hi> Though this Preſence be a Subſtance, yet it is not the whole Subſtance of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> For in former Times, all Sate together; as well <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>Subjects:</hi> And then, it was no Prejudice to His Prerogative, to have ſuch a <hi>Monopoly</hi> Examined.</p>
               <p>If you ſtand upon Law, and diſpute of the Prerogative, hark what <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith;<note place="margin">He gives the <hi>Speaker</hi> a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>Prerogativam noſtram nemo audeat Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putare,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For my own Part, I like not theſe Courſes ſhould be taken. And you, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> ſhould perform the Charge Her <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> gave unto you at the Beginning of this <hi>Parliament, Not to receive Bills of this Nature.</hi> For Her <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Ears be open to all our Grievances, and Her Hands ſtretched out to every Man's Petition.</p>
               <p>For the Matter of Acceſs, I like it well, ſo it be firſt moved, and the Way prepared. I had rather all the Patents were burnt, than Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſhould loſe the Hearts of ſo many Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as is pretended She will.</p>
               <p>I will tell you what I think of theſe <hi>Monopolies;</hi> I take them to be of Three Natures: Some of a Free Nature, and Good; ſome Void of themſelves; ſome both Good, and Void.</p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:107812:115"/>
               <p>For the Firſt; For the <hi>Prince</hi> to Diſpenſe with Penal Laws: That is left to the Alteration of Sovereignty; I mean, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and Irrevocable.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Second:</hi> As to grant that which taketh from the Subject his Birth-right; and ſuch Men as deſire ſuch Patents, I count them <hi>Miſdoers,</hi> and wicked and wilful Offenders.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Third:</hi> As the Licenſe for the Matter of <hi>Cards, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore, I think it very fit to have a New Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to conſider what Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> may grant, and what not; And what Courſe we ſhall take, and upon what Points, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Stanhop,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hone,</hi> were ſent from the Lords with a Bill, Entituled, <hi>An Act for the Uniting of</hi> Eye <hi>and</hi> Dunſden, <hi>to the Mannor of</hi> Sunning.</p>

               <hi>I am loth to Speak what I know, lest perhaps I ſhould Diſpleaſe. The Prerogative Royal is that which is now in queſtion, and which the Laws of the Land have ever allowed and maintained. My Motion then ſhall be but this: That We may be Suitors unto Her</hi> Majeſty, <hi>That the Patentees ſhall have no other Remedies, than by the Laws of the Realm they may have; and that our Act may be drawn accordingly.</hi>
            </p>

And becauſe the</hi> Houſe <hi>ſeems greatly to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud it, may it pleaſe you, Mr.</hi> Speaker, <hi>to put it to the Queſtion,</hi> Whether that ſhall be Determined of, at the Committee.</p>

            <p>Order <hi>is Attended with theſe Two Hand-Maids,</hi> Gravity <hi>and</hi> Zeal; <hi>but</hi> Zeal <hi>with Diſcretion. I have been, though Unworthy, a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this</hi> Houſe, <hi>in Six or Seven</hi> Parliaments; <hi>yet never did I ſee the</hi> Houſe <hi>in ſo great Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I believe, there was never, in any</hi> Parliament, <hi>a more tender Point handled, than the Liberty of the</hi> Subject, <hi>and the Prerogative Royal of the</hi> Prince: <hi>What an Indignity then is it to the</hi> Prince, <hi>and Injury to the</hi> Subject, <hi>that when any is Diſcuſſing this Point, he ſhould be Cryed and Coughed down? This is more fit for a</hi> Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-School, <hi>than a</hi> Parliament. <hi>I have been a Councellor of State theſe Twelve Years; yet never did I know it ſubject to Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:107812:117"/>of Levity or Diſorder: Much more ought we to be, in ſo Great and Grave an Aſſembly. Why? we have had Speeches, and Speech upon Speech, without either Order or Diſcretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One would have had us to proceed by Bill, and ſee if the</hi> Queen <hi>would have denyed it. Another, that the Patents-ſhould be brought here before Us, and Cancelled; and this were Bravely done. Others would have Us to proceed by way of Petition; which of Both, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is Beſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for the</hi> Firſt, (<hi>and eſpecially, for the</hi> Second) <hi>It is ſo Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, that I think, We ſhould have had as bad Succeſs, as the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <hi>himſelf would have wiſhed in ſo good a Cauſe. Why? If Idle Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had been followed, we ſhould have gone (forſooth) to the</hi> Queen, <hi>with a Petition to have Repealed a</hi> Patent <hi>or</hi> Monopoly <hi>of</hi> Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co-Pipes [Which Mr. <hi>Wingfeild</hi>'s Note had] <hi>and I know not how many Conceipts.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This Act was brought in after Commitment, by Sir <hi>Edward Hobby,</hi> who at the delivery thereof, ſhewed to the Houſe, That they had put out <hi>Eſq</hi> in the Title, in reſpect that they would not leave ſuch a Title as <hi>Eſq</hi> for a Monument of Record in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, leſt perhaps, it might in After-ages be a prejudice to the Title of the Lord <hi>Abergaveny.</hi> Alſo we have (ſaid he) left out all other Words, and Clauſes touching that Point.

And thus they both being at the Committee, with their Councel, have given conſent to the Bill: The Gentlemen are both in the Houſe, and can teſtify as much.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I think it good, it were put to the Queſtion for Ingroſſing. And ſo it was; and all ſaid, <hi>I, I, I.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Speaker</hi> delivers a Meſſage from the Queen.</note>It pleaſed Her Majeſty to command me to attend upon Her Yeſterday in the Afternoon: From whom, I am to deliver unto you all, Her Majeſties moſt gratious Meſſage, ſent by my unworthy ſelf.</p>
                     <p>She yeildeth you all hearty thanks, for your care, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard of thoſe things that concern Her State and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Conſequently our ſelves; whoſe Good She hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes tendred as Her own: For our ſpeedy Reſolution in making ſo haſty and free a Subſidy; which commonly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded and never went before our Councels.</p>
                     <p>For our Loyalty, I will aſſure you, with ſuch and ſo great Zeal of Affection She uttered, and ſhewed the ſame, that to expreſs it with our Tongues we are not able, neither our Hearts to conceive it. It pleaſed Her Majeſty to ſay unto me, That if She had an Hundred Tongues, She could not expreſs our hearty good Wills: And further, She ſaid, That as She had ever held our Good, moſt dear; ſo the laſt Day of ours, or Her Life, ſhould Witneſs it. And that if the leaſt of Her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were Grieved, and Her ſelf not Touched, She appealed to the Throne of Almighty God; how careful She hath been, and will be to defend Her People from all Oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p>She ſaid, That partly by Intimation of Her Councel, and partly by divers Petitions that have been Delivered unto Her, both going to Chappel, and alſo Walking abroad; She un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, That divers Patents that She had granted, were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous unto Her Subjects, and that the Subſtitutes of the Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, had uſed great Oppreſſion. But, She ſaid, She never aſſented to Grant any thing that was <hi>Malum in ſe.</hi> And if in the Abuſe of Her Grant, there be any thing that is Evil, which She took Knowledge there was, She, Her ſelf, would take preſent Order for Reformation thereof.</p>
                     <p>I cannot Expreſs unto you, the apparent indignation of Her Majeſty, towards theſe Abuſes. She ſaid, Her Kingly Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative was tender, and therefore deſireth us not to ſpeak or doubt of Her careful Reformation. For, She ſaid, her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement given a little before the late Troubles (<hi>meaning the Earl of</hi> Eſſex's <hi>Matters</hi>) by the unfortunate event of them, was not ſo hindred, but that ſince that time, even in the midſt of Her moſt weighty and great Occaſions, She thought upon them. And that this ſhould not Suffice, but that further Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould be taken preſently, and not <hi>In futuro.</hi> (For that alſo was a Word which I take it, Her Majeſty uſed) and that ſome ſhould preſently be Repealed, ſome Suſpended, and not put in Execution: but ſuch as ſhould firſt have a Trial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, for the Good of Her People.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the Abuſes, Her Wrath was ſo Incenſed, that, She
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:107812:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſaid, She neither would, nor could ſuffer ſuch to eſcape with Impunity.</p>
                     <p>So to my unſpeakable Comfort, She hath made me the Meſſenger of this Her gratious thankfulneſs, and care.</p>
                     <p>Now we ſee, that the Axe of Her Princely Juſtice is put to the Root of the Tree. And ſo we ſee Her Gracious goodneſs hath prevented our Councels, and Conſultations; for which <hi>God</hi> make us thankful, and ſend her long, and long to Reign amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>If through my own Weakneſs of Memory, Want of Utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Frailty of my ſelf, I have omitted any thing of Her Majeſties Commands, I do moſt humbly crave pardon for the ſame; And do beſeech, the Honourable Perſons, which do aſſiſt this Chair, and were preſent before her Majeſty, at the Delivery hereof, to ſupply and help my Imperfections, which, joyned with my Fear, have cauſed me, no doubt, to forget ſomething that I ſhould have Delivered unto you.</p>
                     <p>After a little Pauſe and Silence, the Councel talking one with another, Mr. <hi>Secretary Cecil</hi> ſtood up, and ſaid.</p>
                     <p>There needs no Supply of the Memory of the <hi>Speaker;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> Speaks to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> but becauſe he deſires ſome-that be about him, to aid his Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and becauſe the reſt of my Fellows be Silent; I will take upon me to Deliver ſomething, which I both then heard and ſince know.</p>
                     <p>I was preſent with the reſt of my Fellow-Councellours, and the Meſſage was the ſame, that hath been told you. And the cauſe hath not proceeded from any particular courſe thought upon, but upon private Information of ſome particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. I have been very Inquiſitive after them, and of the Cauſe, why more importunity was now uſed, than before; which I am afraid comes by being acquainted with ſome courſe of our Proceeding in this Houſe.</p>
                     <p>There are no Patents now of Force, which ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be revoked; for what Patent ſoever is Granted, there ſhall be left, to the overthrow of that Patent, a Liberty agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law. There is no Patent, but if it be <hi>Malum in ſe,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> was ill appriſed in Her Grant; but all to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality are unacceptable. I take it, there is no Patent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Execution thereof, hath been Injurious; would that had never been Granted. I hope there ſhall never be more. (All the Houſe ſaid, <hi>Amen.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>In particular, moſt of theſe Patents have been ſupported with Letters of Aſſiſtance from Her Majeſties <hi>Privy Councel;</hi> but whoſoever look upon them, they ſhall find they carry no other Style than with Relation to the Patent. I dare aſſure you, that from hence-forth there ſhall be no more Granted; and how many ſoever have been already Granted, they ſhall all be revoked.</p>
                     <p>But, to whom do they repair with theſe Letters? To ſome out-houſe, to ſome deſolate Widow, to ſome ſimple Cottage, or poor ignorant People; who rather than they would be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107812:119"/>and undo themſelves by coming up hither, they will give any thing in Reaſon for theſe <hi>Caterpillars</hi> Satisfaction. The Notice of this, is now publick. And you will, perhaps, judge this to be a Tale to ſerve the Time. But I would have all Men know thus much, That it's no jeſting with a Court of Parliament; neither dares any Man (for mine own part I dare not) ſo much abuſe all the Subjects of this Kingdom, in a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Conſequence and importance.</p>
                     <p>I ſay therefore, there ſhall be a Proclamation general through the Realm, to notify Her <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Reſolution in this behalf. And becauſe you may Eat your Meats more Savourly than you have done; every Man ſhall have Salt as cheap as he can buy it, or make it, freely without danger of that Patent, which ſhall be pereſently Revoked. The ſame Benefit ſhall they have which have cold Stomacks both for <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and the like: And they which have weak Stomacks, ſhall have <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> ſet at Liberty: <hi>Train-Oil</hi> ſhall go the ſame Way; <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Blubber</hi> ſhall March in the ſame Rank: <hi>Bruſhes</hi> and <hi>Bottles</hi> indure the like Judgment. The Patent for <hi>Polldavis,</hi> if it be not called in, it ſhall be. <hi>Oade,</hi> which as I take it, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained either by Law or Statute, but only by Proclamation (I mean from the Sowing thereof) though, for the ſaving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it might receive good Diſputation; yet for your Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Queen's</hi> Pleaſure is, to revoke that Proclamation: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly She Prayeth thus much, That when She cometh in Progreſs to ſee you in the Country, She may not be driven out of your Towns, by ſuffering it to infect the Air too neer them. Thoſe that deſire to go Sprucely in their Ruffs, may with leſs charge than Accuſtomed, obtain their Wiſh; for Starch, which hath ſo much been Proſecuted, ſhall now be Repealed. There are other Patents for new Drapery, which ſhall be ſuſpended, and leſt to Law: <hi>Iriſh-Yarn,</hi> a Matter that I am ſorry there is no cauſe of Complaint for; for the Savageneſs of the People, and the War, hath Fruſtrated the Hope of the Patentee, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of good Service, and Deſert, a good Subject to Her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and a good Member of the <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> (Mr. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marthen;</hi>) notwithſtanding, it ſhall be ſuſpended and left to the Law. The Patent for <hi>Calf-Skins,</hi> and <hi>Pelts,</hi> ſhall indure the Cenſure of the Law.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt tell you, There is no Reaſon that all ſhould be Revoked; for the <hi>Queen</hi> means not to be ſwept out of Her Prerogative: I ſay it ſhall be ſuſpended, if the Law doth not warrant it. There is another Servant of her <hi>Majeſties,</hi> (Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlow</hi>) one of Her Penſioners, an Honeſt Gentleman, and a Faithful Servant; he hath the Patent for <hi>Steel,</hi> which once Mr. <hi>Beal</hi> had; theſe, too, becauſe of Complaints ſhall be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. There is another, that hath the Patent of <hi>Leather,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Dier,</hi> a Gentleman of good Deſert, Honeſt, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Wiſe. This was Granted unto him <hi>Thirty</hi> Years ago, it crept not in by the new Miſ-government of the Time; yet this ſhall alſo be ſuſpended. The Patent for <hi>Cards</hi> ſhall be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107812:119"/>ſuſpended, and Tryed by Common-Law. The Patent for <hi>Glaſſes,</hi> which though I do leaſt apprehend to be prejudicial to the Publick Good; yet it is to be left to the Law. There is another Patent for <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> that hath been both Accuſed and Slandered: It digs in every Man's Houſe; it removes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, and generally troubleth the Subject. For this, I beſeech you, be Contented; yet I know, I am too blame to deſire it, being Condemned by you <hi>in foro Conſcientiae:</hi> But I aſſure you, it ſhall be fully ſifted, and tryed <hi>in foro Judicii.</hi> Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> meaneth to take this Patent to Her ſelf; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with Her Councel, concerning the ſame: For, I muſt tell you, The Kingdom is not ſo well furniſhed with Powder, as it ſhould be. But, if it be thought fit (upon Advice) to be Cancelled, Her <hi>Majesty</hi> commanded me to tell you, <hi>That though She be willing to help the grave</hi> Gentleman <hi>that hath that Patent; yet out of the abundant Deſire that She hath, to give you compleat Satisfaction, it ſhall be Repealed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This hath come to the Ear of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and I have been moſt Earneſt to ſearch for the Inſtrument; and as a Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of State, have done my beſt Endeavour to ſalve this Sore: But I fear, we are not ſecret amongſt our ſelves. Then muſt I needs give you This, for a future Caution; <hi>That whatſoever is ſubject to a Publick Expoſition, cannot be Good.</hi> Why, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>-Matters are ordinarily Talked of in the Streets. I have heard my ſelf, being in my Coach, theſe Words ſpoken aloud: <hi>God proſper thoſe that further the Overthrow of theſe</hi> Monopolies! <hi>God ſend the Prerogative touch not our Liberty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will not wrong any ſo much, as to imagine he was of this <hi>Houſe;</hi> yet let me give you this Note, That the Time was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more apt to Diſorder, or make Ill Interpretations of Good Meanings. I think thoſe Perſons would be glad that all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty were Converted into Popularity: We being here, are but the <hi>Popular Bouch,</hi> and our Liberty, the Liberty of the Subject; and the World is apt to ſlander, moſt eſpecially the Miniſters of Government.</p>
                     <p>Thus much have I ſpoken, to accompliſh my Duty, due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Her <hi>Majesty;</hi> but not to make any further Performance of the well-utter'd, and gravely and truly-deliver'd Speech of the <hi>Speaker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, I muſt crave your Favours a little longer, to make an Apology for my ſelf. I have held the Favour of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> as dear as my Life: And I have been told, That I deſerved for taxing Yeſterday of the <hi>Houſe.</hi> I proteſt, my Zeal to have the Buſineſs go forwards in a right and hopeful Courſe, and my Fear to diſpleaſe Her <hi>Majesty</hi> by a harſh and raſh Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made me ſo much to lay aſide my Diſcretion, that I ſaid, <hi>It might rather be termed a School, than a Councel;</hi> or to that Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                     <p>But, if any think by this Speech, I called him <hi>School-Boy,</hi> he both Wrongs me, and Miſtakes me Shall I tell you what <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi> ſaid to the Clamours which the <hi>Athenians</hi> made? That
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107812:120"/>they were <hi>Pueriles &amp; dignos Pueris:</hi> And yet, that was a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular State. And, I wiſh, that whatſoever is here ſpoken, may be Buried in theſe Walls. Let us take Example by the <hi>Jewiſh Synagogue,</hi> who would alwayes <hi>Sepelire Senatum cum Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore;</hi> and not blaze their own Follies and Imperfections. If any Man in this <hi>Houſe</hi> ſpeak Wiſely, we do him great wrong to Interrupt him: If Fooliſhly, let us hear him out; we ſhall have the more Cauſe to Tax him. And I do heartily pray, That no Member of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> may <hi>Plus verbis offendere, quàm Concilio Juvare.</hi>

If a Sentence of <hi>Everlasting Happineſs</hi> had been Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced unto me, it could not have made me ſhew more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Joy, than now I do; which I cannot refrain here to Expreſs, <hi>(And, as I think, he Wept.)</hi> There could nothing have been more Acceptable to the Subject, than this Meſſage.

               <p>I do agree, with all my Heart, in the Firſt Part of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Motion, that laſt ſpake; but do utterly miſlike the Latter: For, it is not to be intended, we ſhould have had ſo Good and Gracious a Meſſage, if the Truth of ſome particular Speeches had been delivered unto Her. And now, for us to Accuſe our ſelves, by Excuſing a Fault with which we are not Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were a thing (in my Opinion) inconvenient, and unfitting the Wiſdom of this <hi>Houſe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Comptroller</hi> ſhewed, How neceſſary <hi>Cordage</hi> was to the Land, and alſo <hi>Flax</hi> and <hi>Hemp;</hi> which we might have in our own Land, if it happen'd, that Intercourſe of Traffique were hindered in other Countries: And therefore, he wiſhed, That a Bill of this Nature might not ſo ſlightly be Rejected; but, that it might be once again Read, and Committed.</p>

               <p>Four Exceptions have been taken to the Bill: That the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> ſhould not pay for the <hi>Wife,</hi> nor the <hi>Father</hi> for the <hi>Son,</hi> nor the <hi>Master</hi> for the <hi>Servant:</hi> And, That <hi>Recuſants</hi> that pay the Penalty of <hi>Twenty Pound</hi> the Month, by Force of the Statute 23 <hi>Reginae,</hi> ſhould not be included: All theſe Penalties are now Excluded.</p>

               <p>It is manifeſt, and I think no Man doubteth, but that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore the <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> were both one, without Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and, That the United Body of the <hi>Parliament</hi> had the ſame Privileges, and Juriſdictions which we now have. And, Though there be a Ceſſion or Separation of the United Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yet the Privileges do ſtill remain entire: For, by moſt Antient Records of this Realm, it plainly may appear, That the ſame Privileges ſerve Both <hi>Houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt Precedent is in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt's Dayes, when the <hi>Templars</hi> had certain Tenants in the <hi>Parliament-Houſe,</hi> which were behind with their Rents; and they made Humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>King,</hi> That they might Diſtrain either their Bodies, or their Goods for the ſame.

               <p>The Second is, One <hi>Bago de Clare</hi> did preſume to ſerve a Citation upon <hi>Edmond</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> within <hi>Weſlminster-Hall,</hi> as he was going to the Parliament; for which he was ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and made to ſubmit himſelf <hi>De alto &amp; baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> and a Fine of <hi>Two Thouſand Marks</hi> impoſed upon him; which he truly Paid.

               </p>
               <p>And our Uſe at this Day is not warranted by Precedents of Ancient Times; For, if a Man had been Arreſted upon a <hi>Subpoena,</hi> upon Notice given, he ſhould have had a Writ of Privilege, which of courſe Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> muſt have allowed.</p>
            </q>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Britten</hi> ſhewed, That a Member of the Houſe, Mr. <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> the Lawyer, was ſerved with a <hi>Privy-Seal,</hi> out of the <hi>Court of Wards,</hi> by one <hi>Thomas Deane</hi> ſervant to Mrs. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> a Widow, who when he delivered the Proceſs, being told it would be taken in ill part by the <hi>Houſe,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>He cared not;</hi> being told the <hi>Houſe</hi> would puniſh him for it, and bring him on his Knees, <hi>He Anſwered, His Miſtreſs would bear him out, and ſhe made no doubt, ſhe ſhould find as good Friends there, as he had any.</hi> Whereupon, the <hi>Houſe</hi> Ordered, That ſhe and her ſervant ſhould be ſent for by the <hi>Serjeant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Holcroft</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">That many Complaints were made, but none Puniſhed; many ſent for, but none Appeared. There was a Matter complained of, by one Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that had his Man Arreſted at his Heels, by the <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe</hi> of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and nothing was done therein.</q>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">That after the <hi>Houſe</hi> had given Order to go, he came (ſaid he) unto me to Certify him of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Particulars, and what he hath ſince done he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</q>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Roger Owen</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">May it pleaſe you, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> my ſelf being choſen for the Shire, I think it my part to Speak ſomething, ſeeing the Burgeſſes for the Town neglect their Duties, in not Speaking. True it is, that ſuch Order was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Houſe; but Mr. <hi>Morrice,</hi> and ſome others being willing to let me have the Examination of the Matter, they came before me. And upon Examination (a Wife Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no doubt, <hi>ſaid Mr. Secretary Cecil</hi>) I found he was no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Servant, but only a Servant that brought him part of the Way, and was to go no further with him, towards the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; whereupon, I think, the <hi>Serjeant</hi> having ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ſtaid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">It ſeems this Matter, is ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After three Congees made, the Serjeant ſhewed <hi>He was with Mr.</hi> Morrice, <hi>and that he offered him to ſend one of his Men; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was in doubt of finding him, he deſired ſome part of his Fees, or Money for his Charges, or Horſes, or elſe he would find Horſes, and get one of his Fellow-Serjeants to go, becauſe he could not well be ſpared from his Service; if not, he would for his more Expedition procure a Purſuivant, to go with a Warrant under Mr.</hi> Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's <hi>Hand, and the Honourable of the</hi> Privy-Councel' <hi>in this</hi> Houſe; <hi>for the more ſpeedy Paſſage. All which Courſes, Mr.</hi> Morrice <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. I hope the</hi> Houſe <hi>meaneth not that I ſhould go or ſend on mine own Purſe, or hazard the Charge my ſelf. And therefore, I hope this will be Sufficient for my Diſcharge,</hi> And all the Houſe Cried, <hi>I, I, I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So no more was ſaid of that Matter; For the <hi>Speaker</hi> ſeemed to Favour the Cauſe. And therefore he preſently ſtood up, and asked <hi>If the</hi> Houſe <hi>would have the Priſoners in, which Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sir</hi> Edmund Morgan, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Pemberton? And all ſaid, <hi>I, I, I.</hi> And by this Shift, the former Matter was ſhuffled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Chriſtopher Kennel,</hi> and <hi>William Mackerles,</hi> were brought to the Bar, the one for Serving Sir <hi>Edmund Morgan,</hi> and the other Mr. <hi>Pemberton</hi> with a <hi>Sabpaena.</hi>

            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtopher Kennel</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> and the reſt of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Houſe,</hi> I am, though poor, a Gentleman Born, and known to many in this Affembly: this perhaps, may be a cauſe to aggravate my Offence. I hope there is no Man here, that doth not know me; and I am ſure there is no Man which knoweth me, but thinketh, I would not willingly commit ſuch an Offence as this is.</p>
               <p>I have been ſometimes, (though unworthy) a Member of this <hi>Houſe.</hi> And I have ſeen and known the Juſtice of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> in the like Caſes. But, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> if there be either Honelty, or Chriſtianity in me, by the ſame I do proteſt, that I knew not Sir <hi>Edmund Mergin</hi> was of the Parliament-<hi>Houſe;</hi> which, I think he will avouch himſelf. And as ſoon as I heard it, I went to Sir <hi>Edmuna's</hi> Chamber, where I found him, to reconcile my ſelf, and make an Attonement with him. And as I was doing this, Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> came into the Chamber, and there Arreſted me, whoſe Arreſt I moſt willingly Obeyed, and do now acknowledge my ſelf to have Offended, though not Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly.</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe you, I have ſerved Her Majeſty theſe 18. Years, in Her Wars; and in all my Life, I was never Treſpaſſer in any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this kind or nature. I therefore do moſt humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, in your Wiſdomes to have Conſideration of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and circumſtances of my Offence. And moſt willingly I do ſubmit my ſelf to your Cenſures.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>William Mackerleſs,</hi> being a poor ſimple Fellow, could ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for himſelf, but only, That he knew not Mr. <hi>Pemberton</hi> to be of the <hi>Houſe.</hi>

            <pb n="257" facs="tcp:107812:122"/>
            <p>So the <hi>Serjeant</hi> was commanded to Remove them both forth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſaid: <hi>Some we Pardon out of Diſcretion, ſome out of Commiſeration. I think, ſet all</hi> Parliaments <hi>together, they will not match this</hi> Parliament <hi>with Numbers of Offences of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and only our Impunity is the Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Edmond Morgan</hi> ſaid: <hi>Mr.</hi> Speaker, <hi>The Gentleman is a Man of good Sort, Deſert, and Carriage: And, I think, if he had known me to be of the</hi> Houſe, <hi>he would not have ſerved me with a</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poena. <hi>Truly, he came to my Lodging, and acknowledged his great Fault, and prayed me to Extenuate it. I proteſt, I think he did not know I was of the</hi> Houſe. <hi>And therefore I pray, in regard of his Perſon, and good Service done to Her</hi> Majeſty, <hi>his Offence may be as freely Remitted by the</hi> Houſe, <hi>as it is by Me: And that it would pleaſe you All, to Refer your Juſtice to Matters of greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</hi> Which was marvellouſly well liked by the <hi>Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pemberton</hi> being asked, What he could ſay? whether <hi>William Mackerles</hi> knew him? He anſwer'd, <hi>I;</hi> and that his Man had told him, he ſaid, <hi>That he knew the ſaid</hi> William <hi>was a very Knave:</hi> And therefore, he would not intreat the Favour of the <hi>Houſe;</hi> but let him have the Juſtice of the <hi>Houſe.</hi> Which Speech was generally miſliked.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> a Councellor of <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> ſhewed unto the <hi>Houſe,</hi> That one <hi>Holland,</hi> a Scrivener by <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and his Man, had Beaten his Servant; and he humbly prayed, they might be ſent for. And the Queſtion grew upon Diſpute in the <hi>Houſe, whether this were Puniſhable:</hi> And after, upon a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vouched by Mr. <hi>Roger Owen,</hi> of 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. touching a Knight of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> coming towards the <hi>Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. it was agreed, That they ſhould be ſent for.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Kennel,</hi> and <hi>Mackerles</hi> were brought to the Bar: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Offence laid open by the <hi>Speaker,</hi> he ſaid: <hi>It pleaſed the</hi> Houſe, <hi>to have ſo favourable Conſideration of their Offence, That they ſhould only have but Three Dayes Impriſonment, in the Cuſtody of the</hi> Serjeant, <hi>and pay his Fees.</hi>

            <p>But Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſpake: <q rend="inline">I told you of late, That Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> accepted of our Loves, and Thanks: But She Her ſelf, from our Selves by our <hi>Speaker,</hi> would receive none, till She had performed Her Promiſe; which you may ſee is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and Proclamations extant in every Mans Hand.

            </p>
            <p>So the Committee was put over till <hi>Tueſday;</hi> and they went to Name thoſe that ſhould go: At the laſt, at the Lower-End of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> they cryed, <hi>All, All All;</hi> and ſo none were Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Holland</hi> a Scrivener at <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and <hi>Laurence Brook</hi> his Man, were brought to the Bar, for that they had beaten Mr. <hi>Fleetwood's</hi> Man, a Member of the <hi>Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Matter was thus related to the <hi>Houſe,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> viz. That he was bound as Surety with one Mr. <hi>Heydon,</hi> for payment of Money at <hi>Holland's</hi> Shop, which was paid and told there, and the Bag, after, put up. Mr. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> as he came by <hi>Holland's</hi> Shop, was called in by <hi>Holland</hi> into the Shop, and after into a Parlour; where after chafeing and ſwearing that there wanted <hi>Ten Pounds Six Shillings</hi> of the Sum in the Bag; and that he ſhould not have his Bond, until he had it: Mr. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> called his man to juſtify the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who did ſo. <hi>Holland</hi> ſwore he Lyed like a Boy and a Raſcal. To which the Boy Anſwered. <hi>If you ſay ſo, I ſay, that whoſoever ſaith there was not ſo much Money, he Lyeth;</hi> With that, <hi>Holland</hi> ran at him, and thruſt him into a Chimny-Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and would have Stabbed him, if Mr. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> had not taken the Daggar from him. The Scriveners man, who heard the busſle, came in, and not only ſtruck Mr. <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> but helped the Maſter to Beat the Man, and after, went again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Shop, through which Mr. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and his Man went forth. The Boy Mocked and jeared at him, and Mr. <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> telling him, <hi>They ſhould both anſwer it in the Parliament-Houſe;</hi> The Boy Anſwered, <hi>My Maſter will warrant me, I care not.</hi> And it ſeemed by <hi>Holland,</hi> who could not well be heard, the aforeſaid matter was true.</p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:107812:124"/>
            <p>So, after he was removed, there was a great Diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould be ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> or Committed to the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant.</hi> And, I verily think, he had gone to the <hi>Tower,</hi> if Mr. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> had not by chance ſpoken a word, touching Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Maynard,</hi> Secretary to the Old <hi>Lord Treaſurer,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened thus: When <hi>Holland,</hi> Kneeling at the Bar, had ſpoken for himſelf; the <hi>Speaker</hi> asking Mr. <hi>Fleetwood What he could ſay?</hi> He told all the Matter aforeſaid. But as he was at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome ſaid, <hi>At the Bar, At the Bar;</hi> which Mr. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> took to be a great Diſgrace, and ſaid: <hi>Mr.</hi> Speaker, <hi>I have heard that Mr.</hi> Anthony Maynard <hi>hath given out Speeches in the behalf of this</hi> Holland; <hi>and for ſome ſpecial Reaſon, I think he is the Man that ſaith,</hi> At the Bar.

            <p>Then the <hi>Speaker</hi> wiſhed him, To leave that as a Private Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo fall to the Point.</p>
            <p>After which, he told the whole Matter aforeſaid, though I verily think, there was no ſuch thing done by Mr. <hi>Maynard;</hi> for none ſpake againſt him, and for the eaſy Puniſhment of the Scrivener, but Mr. <hi>Maynard's</hi> Friends, even ſome of the greateſt.

The other was <hi>Parry,</hi> that for a Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Contemptuous Speech, made even there (pointing to the Second Bench) was likewiſe Committed. Now this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was not of the like Nature, and very ſmall; not done to the Perſon of any Member of this Houſe. And therefore, I think the <hi>Serjeant's</hi> Cuſtody puniſhment ſufficient.</q>

                     <p>Since I was <hi>Queen,</hi> yet, did I never put my Pen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Grant, but that, upon Pretext and Semblance made unto Me, it was both Good and Beneficial to the Subject in general; though a private Profit to ſome of My Antient Servants, who had deſerved well at My Hands. But the Contrary being found by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, I am exceedingly beholding to ſuch Subjects, as would move the ſame at the firſt. And I am not ſo Simple to ſuppoſe, but that there are ſome of the <hi>Lower-Houſe,</hi> whom theſe Grievances never touched. And for Them, I think they ſpake out of Zeal for their Countries, and not out of Spleen, or Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Affection, as being Parties grieved. And I take
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:107812:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>it exceeding Gratefully from them; becauſe it gives Us to know, that no Reſpects or Intereſts had moved them other than the minds they bear to ſuffer no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of our Honour, and our ſubjects Loves unto Us. The zeal of which Affection, tending to eaſe my People, and Knit their hearts unto Me, I embrace with a Princely care; for (above all earthly Treaſure) I eſteem my People's Love, more than which I deſire not to Merit.</p>
                     <p>That my Grants ſhould be grievous to my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Oppreſſions privileged under colour of our Patents; our Kingly Dignity ſhall not ſuffer it: yea, when I heard it, I could give no reſt unto my Thoughts untill I had Reformed it.</p>
                     <p>Shall they think to eſcape unpuniſhed, that have thus Oppreſſed you, and have been reſpectleſs of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and regardleſs of Our Honour? No, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I aſſure you, were it not more for Conſcience-ſake, than for any Glory or Increaſe of Love, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; theſe Errours, Troubles, Vexations and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions done by theſe Varlets and lewd Perſons, not worthy the name of Subjects, ſhould not eſcape without Condigne Puniſhment. But I perceive they dealt with Me like Phyſitians, who Adminiſtring a Drug, make it more acceptable by giving it a good Aromatical Savour, or when they give Pills, do Gild them all over.</p>
                     <p>I have ever uſed to ſet the laſt Judgment-Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Eyes, as ſo to Rule, as I ſhall be Judged to Anſwer before a higher Judge, to whoſe Judgment-Seat I do Appeal, That never Thought was Cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in my Heart, that tended not to my People's Good. And now, if my Kingly Bounty have been abuſed, and my Grants turned to the Hurt of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, contrary to My Will and Meaning; or if any in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority under Me, have neglected or perverted what I have Committed to them; I hope God will not lay their Culps and Offences to my Charge; who though there were danger in repealing our Grants, yet what danger would I not rather incur for your Good, than I would ſuffer them ſtill to continue?</p>

                     <p>I know the Title of a KING is a Glorious Title.

                     <p>To be a KING, and wear a Crown, is a thing more Glorious to them that ſee it, than it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to them that bear it: For my ſelf, I was never ſo much inticed with the Glorious Name of a KING, or Royal Authority of a QUEEN, as delighted that <hi>GOD</hi> had made Me his Inſtrument to maintain his Truth and Glory, and to Defend this Kingdom (as I ſaid) from Peril, Diſhonour, Tyranny, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                     <p>There will never <hi>Queen</hi> ſit in my Seat, with more Zeal to my Country, Care for my Subjects, and that ſooner with willingneſs will venture her Life for your Good and Safety, than My Self. For it is not my deſire to Live nor Reign longer, than my Life and Reign ſhall be for your Good. And though you have had, and may have many Princes, more Mighty and Wiſe, ſitting in this State; yet you never had, or ſhall have any that will be more Careful and Loving.</p>
                     <p>Shall I aſcribe any thing to my Self, and my Sexly Weakneſs? I were not worthy to Live then; and of all, moſt unworthy of the great Mercies I have had from God, who hath ever yet given me a Heart, which never yet feared Forreign or Home-Enemy. I ſpeak it to give <hi>God</hi> the Praiſe, as a Teſtimony before you, and not to Attribute any thing to My Self. For I, O <hi>Lord,</hi> What am I, whom Practices and Perils paſt ſhould not fear? Or, What can I do? <hi>[Theſe Words She ſpake with a great Emphaſis.]</hi> That I ſhould ſpeak for any Glory, <hi>God</hi> forbid.</p>

            <p>The Bill of <hi>Llandouerer</hi> was Read; and it was put to the Queſtion; I ſtood up to ſpeak againſt it, according to a Note given me by Mr. <hi>John Stephens,</hi> an Honeſt young Gentleman of <hi>Lincolns-Inn.</hi> The Effect thereof, is:</p>
            <p>At the <hi>Parliament</hi> 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 26. the Shires of <hi>Wales</hi> were Divided, and the Land of <hi>Lour</hi> limited in <hi>Pembrook-ſhire.</hi> At the <hi>Parliament</hi> 34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 28. <hi>Cauſtiffan, Uſterloys,</hi> and <hi>Laughern,</hi> by the ſame former Act being in <hi>Pembrook-ſhire,</hi> were by the ſaid laſt Act appointed in <hi>Carmarthen:</hi> Since which time, the Land of <hi>Lour</hi> hath been reputed in <hi>Carmarthen-ſhire.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Swearing</hi> is a thing Moral, and toucheth the <hi>Soul;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fitter to be ſpoken of in a <hi>Pulpit</hi> than a <hi>Parliament.</hi> If the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> hath ſworn, That his Plague, ſhall not depart from the <hi>Houſe</hi> of the <hi>Swearer,</hi> Why ſhould not we ſeek to ſuppreſs this Vice, which brings a plague which breeds Mortality, that breeds Deſtruction, Deſolation and utter Ruin of the Common-Wealth?</p>
               <p>If He forbid us to Swear, and we fear not his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Think you a Penalty of <hi>Ten Shillings,</hi> as is here ſet down, will make us refrain this Iniquity?

               <p>So may I ſay of this Bill: It is as hard for this Penalty to reſtrain this Sin, as it is for Religion to ſpring out of the Common-Law, and to take Effect. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>That a Men may be</hi> Bonus Civis, <hi>and yet not</hi> Bonus Vir. And though I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the Sin, yet I deny not, but the Sinner may be a good Member. <hi>Moſes</hi> when he ſaw <hi>God,</hi> could but ſee his Back-Parts only; and no Man ever ſaw more: But theſe <hi>Swearers</hi> Swear by all his Parts ſo perfectly, as if they had ſeen Film all over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> made a Law, That the <hi>Swearer</hi> ſhould be Drowned. Another Law was made, That a certain Sum ſhould be paid preſently, ſo ſoon as he had Sworn, or elſe the <hi>Swearer</hi> to loſe his Head. We uſe ſo much Lenity in our Law, as we had as good make no Law.

               <p>Why, we have had here Five Bills: One againſt <hi>Swearing,</hi> another for <hi>Going to Church, Good Ale, Drunkenneſs,</hi> and—This is as good to them as a <hi>Subſidy,</hi> and <hi>Two Fifteens.</hi> Only in that Point I miſlike the Bill; for the reſt, I could wiſh it good Paſſage.</p>

Now if their be <hi>One Hundred</hi> Apprentices, not <hi>Four</hi> come to the perfection of Painting by the Life, and all their Trade and Gain in the other things, is by the <hi>Plaiſterers</hi> now uſurped, who are only to meddle with Loame, Morter, and the like, yet the <hi>Painter-ſtainers</hi> have given them leave to uſe their <hi>Four</hi> Principal Colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>She ſaid: <hi>She was not allured with the Royal Authority of a</hi> KING, <hi>neither did She Attribute any thing to Her Self; but all to the Glory of</hi> GOD.

            <p>A Bill to Reform the Abuſes in Weights and Meaſures, by the Default of the <hi>Clerk of the Market,</hi> and other Officers, Read: To which,—<note place="margin">A Bill about Weights and Meaſures. Mr. <hi>Fretſwick</hi> ſpeaks to it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fretſwick,</hi> Knight of <hi>Darby-ſhire,</hi> ſpake, and ſaid: <hi>In that I ſpeak being leaſt Worthy, I hope it will be deemed to proceed from Affection, not Preſumption. Beſides, I have learnt it for a Rule in this</hi> Houſe: It is better to venture Credit, than Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are</hi> Three <hi>things to be conſider'd in this Bill; The Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, the Neceſſity of the Remedy, and the Conveniency of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the Inconveniency; no Man but knows it, who knows the State of his Country: In Mine, there is nothing more generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, than the Inequality of Meaſures. The Rich have two Meaſures; with One he Buyes, and Ingroſſeth Corn in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that's the Greater: With the Other he Retails it at Home, to his poor Neighbours; that's the Leſſer. This is the great and just Complaint of All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, after many other Matters moved upon the Statutes, the Bill was Committed: The Time of Meeting, appointed on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> in the Afternoon, in this <hi>Houſe.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Roger Owen</hi> ſpake to it, and ſaid: <hi>That he miſliked the Bill, for Two Reſpects: The One, for the Penalty; the Other, in reſpect of the Party puniſhing: This is the</hi> Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the</hi> Firſt: <hi>The Penalty is</hi> Twelve Pence. <hi>It is well known, the pooreſt</hi> Recuſant <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>as well as the Rich, ought to pay his</hi> Twenty Pounds; <hi>and for want of Lands and Goods, his Body is Lyable. And therefore, we ſhall doubly pinch him; which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the</hi> Other: <hi>Touching the</hi> Juſtice, <hi>I think it too great a Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and they already are loaden with a Number of Penal Statutes; yea, a whole</hi> Alphabet, <hi>as appears by</hi> Huſſey, <hi>in the time of</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>the Seventh. And this is ſo obvious, that a</hi> Juſtice of Peace <hi>his Houſe, will be like a</hi> Quarter-Seſſions, <hi>with the Multitude of theſe Complaints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I think alſo, it is an Infringment of</hi> Magna Charta; <hi>for That gives Tryal</hi> per Pares; <hi>but This, by Two Witneſſes, before a</hi> Juſtice of Peace. <hi>And by this Statute, if a</hi> Juſtice of Peace <hi>come into the</hi> Quarter-Seſſions, <hi>and ſay, It is a good Oath, this is as good as an Indictment. Therefore, for my part, away with the Bill.</hi>

               <p>The Matter that I ſhall ſpeak of, is twofold; The Firſt, concerneth the honour of the Queen. The Second, the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Country. Two very high points for me to handle; and require a more Eloquent Diſcourſe than I am able to make. I will uſe no Circumſtance, or with ſuperfluous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abuſe the time, which is precious, but to the Matter.</p>
               <p>I have been of the Parliament Five or Six times, and I have alwayes obſerved by this Houſe, (and I would willingly be reſolved by the Honourable about the Chair) that all the Wars of Her Majeſty are offenſive, and I do not hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: How then comes it, that ſuch a Number of Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Subjects be Spoiled, Robbed, Beaten, Wounded, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves taken and uſed with ſuch extream Torture, Racked, Carried away, Impriſoned, Ranſomed, Fined, and ſome times Executed, and all this time no Wars? But, give me leave to ſay, for theſe Ten Years, I am ſure, the Subjects of this Land on the Sea-Coaſts have undergone theſe Tyrannies. And by whom? Even by two baſe Towns, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Newport.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dunkirk</hi> began with Two Ships, and are now increaſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to Twenty; they be at home at Supper, and the next Day here with us. I muſt needs confeſs, that the great Charge that I know the <hi>Lord Admiral</hi> is at Continually, by lying rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take theſe <hi>Pirates,</hi> is much; but ſend to take them, they ſtraight Fly home. If our Ships return, they are ſtraight here again. I dare boldly ſay, they have done <hi>England</hi> more hurt ſince they began, than all <hi>France,</hi> either in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. or Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:107812:134"/>
               <p>If it be ſo, that theſe Two baſe Towns ſhall ſo affront the Power of this Land, I ſee no Reaſon they ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: For it is a great Diſhonour both to the Queen, and the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>I have heard many ſay, That the <hi>Navy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is the Walls of the Kingdom: and yet, we ſuffer our Ships ſtill to be Deſtroyed; ſome to be Burnt, ſome to be Sunk before our Faces.</p>
               <p>We may compare our Sea-men to Sheep, Feeding upon a Fair Mountain, in the midſt whereof ſtands a Grove full of Wolves. Why, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> we are ſo plagued with them, that they are ſo bold, as now and then to take our Harveſt-Men tardy by Ambuſcadoes.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak it with Grief, and it was Reported unto me by a <hi>Scottiſh-Man,</hi> that Duke <hi>Albertus,</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> ſhould open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſh, That they would pull down ſo many of the Walls of <hi>England,</hi> that they would eaſily make an Entry: and it had been better for Sea-Coaſt-Men to have given the Queen an Hundred Subſidies, that they had been long ſince Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>My humble Motion is, That it would pleaſe the Houſe to enter into Conſideration of theſe things, For the Honour, Good, and Safety, both of the Queen and Kingdom.</p>

               <p>Her Majeſty is continually at Charges; but what inſueth or cometh of it, I never yet knew. In the County of <hi>Kent</hi> at <hi>Shooters-Hill, Gads-Hill, Barram-Down,</hi> &amp;c. if there ſhould be ſeveral Roberies Committed, and the Juſtices look nothing to it, it would be taken in ill part. Every day Men come home, their Goods, and al they have is taken away; yea, their very Apparel. And if the Ships might be alſo carried away; they would do it. This would be Amended and looked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; we have need to Cheriſh this Subject: For I think him to be the beſt and moſt neceſſary Member of the Common-Wealth, I mean the <hi>Navigator.</hi>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Martin.</note> I like not theſe Extravagant Speeches in the Manner, though I miſlike them not in the Matter; they are like to Men whoſe Houſes being on Fire, forgetting themſelves, run out into the Streets like Mad-Men, for Help. That that Cottage of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> (the Flouriſhing Eſtate whereof, is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to our Nation) ſhould ſo much offend us, when we never offer to oppreſs them, is a Marvail. I think there is no Man but underſtandeth the Grief, and no Man which readily knoweth the Remedy.</p>
               <p>I wiſh, that thoſe who firſt propounded this Matter to the Houſe, had alſo laid down ſome Project, though never ſo ſmall, of Remedy: otherwiſe ſuch curſory Motions as theſe,

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Hackwell.</note> I am a Man of that Rank and Condition, that I never ſell, and ſeldome buy, and pay ready Money; and the ſafeſt courſe this Bill offers to me for my particular.</p>
               <p>But the great Miſchief that will redound by it to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, is that which makes me ſpeak. I am not Tranſported with ſuch Vehemency; but if I may be anſwered, I will lay down the <hi>Bucklers.</hi> This Bill hath a good Face, but an ill Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It hath a very good Head-piece, I mean the Title. It is like <hi>Daniel's</hi> Image; It hath a Head of Gold, a Body of Silver, Thighs of Braſs, Legs of Iron, and Feet of Clay.</p>
               <p>If I may pray you to put on a great deal of Patience, for a little time; I will make it ſomewhat plain: We muſt lay down the Reſpects of our own Perſons, and put on others, and their Affections for whom we ſpeak, for they ſpeak for Us.</p>
               <p>If the Matter which was ſpoken of, touch the Poor, then think me a poor Man: he that ſpeaks muſt be ſometimes a Lawyer, ſometimes a Painter, ſometimes a Merchant, ſometimes a mean Artificer. Moſt Men deſire forbearance; this Bill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys it; which tends to the Gain and Good of the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Good alſo of the Buyer: but ſeeking to avoid a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, we fall into an Inconvenience.</p>
               <p>For the manner is unproportionable and unjuſt. If the Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be ſo negligent that he will not care to ſee himſelf diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:107812:136"/>muſt we needs make a Law to help his folly? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is <hi>Caveat emptor.</hi> If this Law goes forwards, the augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of confidence in his ancient habilliments can not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. For if it be a hard Year, the poor Artificer, who hath Wife and Children, and Houſhold to maintain, and lives by the Sweat of his Browes, can not live; for he hath not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to buy all with the Peny; but perhaps he hath Credit, which perhaps may help his preſent neceſſitous Eſtate.</p>
               <p>And beſides, I can teach you all a Trick, how for <hi>Twelve Pence</hi> you may avoid this Statute; and that is, File an Original Writ within the Year, and ſo let it lie dormant.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi> ſaid, <hi>It pleaſed the</hi> Houſe <hi>to Commit a Bill, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation or Explanation of the Law made</hi> 39. <hi>Reginae.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees met, and entred into three Conſiderations: Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Act of 39. <hi>Reginae</hi> Intituled, <hi>An Act to Reform Deceipts, and breaches of Truſts touching Lands given to Charitable Uſes,</hi> ſhould ſtand in force, or no, as now it is?

            <p>And for that purpoſe, being ſo Commanded by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, I have drawn a Bill, referring it to the Wiſdome of the Houſe to be Conſidered of; The Title is, <hi>An Act for the good Execution of Charitable Uſes in this Statute particularly mentioned.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Symnel</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am not againſt this Bill of Subſidie; for, far be it from me, that any ſuch Thought ſhould harbour in my Heart, for I am of that Opinion which</hi> Cicero <hi>the famous Orator was of, That
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:107812:137"/>whoſoever would live in ſafety, muſt abide neceſſity. But all that I have to ſay is this, That we would be humble Suitors to their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that ſit about the Chair, That it would pleaſe them to move Her Majeſty; That that moſt gracious and general free Pardon which it will pleaſe Her Majeſty to beſtow upon us, might have no more ſhortneſs, than it had at the beginning of Her Reign; For if Her Majeſty out of Her Goodneſs took Compaſſion upon us, when we had nothing ſo many Penal and Intrapping Laws, as we now have; I hope that ſeeing the Statutes do abound, it will pleaſe Her, That Her Grace would Superabound. This is my moſt humble Motion, and this I do moſt humbly Pray, That the Houſe would Conſider of it.</hi>

            <p>It was put to the Queſtion, for the Paſſing of the Subſidy-Bill, and all cryed <hi>I, I, I.</hi> and not one <hi>No.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was Moved by Sir <hi>Edward Hobby,</hi> That it might preſently be ſent up to the Lords with all the Houſe, and not by the Privy Council alone, for the more honour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which was well liked, and agreed unto.</p>

            <p>A Bill for the more diligent Reſort to the Church on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, was Read.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Roger Owen</hi> ſaid: <hi>That he was of the ſame Opinion he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been of, for Amendment of the ſaid Bill; and that himſelf was as willing for the Paſſing thereof, as any other. And he deſired, that his Errour, if it were Anſwered, might be judged</hi> Error Amoris, <hi>and not</hi> Amor erroris. <hi>And that as God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a Heart to underſtand, and Lights and Lungs to Cool the Heat of his Heart; ſo, God had given him Underſtanding to cool and temper the Heat of his Soul.</hi> And ſo he Proceeded, and made a brief Repetition, with ſome Arguments for Confirmation of the ſame Speech he firſt made.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Winch</hi> ſaid: <hi>I much marvail, That the Gentleman which laſt ſpake, would ſpeak againſt this Bill, allowing ſo well the matter. I know him well, and his Bringing up, and both his Sufficiency and Zeal, which I very well know, and am well perſwaded of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Speech conſiſted of four Points: The firſt I heard not, The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was, becauſe it repugned</hi> Magna Charta; <hi>The words being,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Capiatur, nemo impriſonetur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> niſi per pares, aut per legem terrae. <hi>The third, becauſe, in Repeal of the Statute of</hi> 1 Reginae, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is taken from the Juſtices of Aſſize. The Fourth, the</hi> 23 Reginae <hi>not Repealed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which he Anſwered all, but not fully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Serjeant <hi>Harris,</hi> moved two Doubts in the Bill; Firſt, That it was by Information, which appeared after to be <hi>vitium Scripto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> for it was Information by Jury: now [by Jury] was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten over [Information] in the interlining, and the Caret made before [Information] whereas it ſhould have been after: the other was, That Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction was taken from the Queen, which indeed I could not find well Anſwered. So the Bill was put to the queſtion, and the moſt Voices were <hi>I, I, I.</hi>

               <hi>At the Committee in the Afternoon in the Houſe, for ſome Courſe to be taken againſt </hi>Dunkirk.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fettyplace</hi> ſhewed a remedy three manner of ways. Firſt, there is a Tranſportation of Ordnance, which being carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Low Countries, he carrieth it to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> or our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: which if it were hindred, doubtleſs our Enemies would find want in time. Secondly, the Law of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage.</hi> Thirdly, it hath been offered to the State, that the Maritine parts might ſave themſelves freely. And I take it to be a Rule in policy, We ſhould not yeild that to our Friends which may be fitting to our Foes againſt us.</p>
            <p>It was concluded at this Committee, that all the Coaſt-Town Men of the Committee, ſhould meet together in the Afternoon on <hi>Monday,</hi> and conſider of ſome Courſe, and relate the ſame to the Committee.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wingfield</hi> ſhewed me the Bill Touching Fenns, which was Exhibited the laſt Parliament, and paſſed both Houſes, but Adviſed upon by Her Majeſty, for ſome reſpects, Entituled, <hi>An Act for the recovering of Three Hundred Thouſand Acres more or leſs, of Waſtes, Mariſh and Watery grounds in the Iſle of</hi> Ely, <hi>and in the Counties of</hi> Cambridge, Huntington, Northampton, Lincoln, Norfolk, Suffolk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On the left ſide, on the Top of the Bill was written, in Roman Letters, <hi>Soit baylle as Signieurs.</hi> And cloſe to the ſame, in another hand, <hi>A ceſt</hi> Bill <hi>avecque les amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; la proviſion a celle Communes les Suis ſont Aſſentu's.</hi> And underneath the Proviſion, Annexed to the Act on the left ſide thereof, cloſe to the writing, was written; <hi>Soit baylle Aux Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes,</hi> And on the back under the Title aforeſaid was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thus.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Bacon <hi>ſaid: I am, Mr.</hi> Speaker,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> reports, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a New Bill for Inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>to tender to this Houſe the Fruit of the Committees Labour, which tends to the comfort of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack of this Realm; I mean the Merchant, which, if it quail, or fall into a Conſumption, the</hi> State <hi>cannot Chooſe but ſhortly be Sick of that Diſeaſe. It is inclining already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Certainty of Gain, is that which this Law provides for. And by Policy of Aſſurance, the ſafety of Goods is Aſſured unto the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; this is the Loadstone that draws him out to adventure, and to ſtreach even the very Punctillio of his Credit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Committees have drawn a New Bill, far different from the Old; the firſt limitted power to the Chancery, this to certain Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners by way of</hi> Oyer <hi>and</hi> Terminer. <hi>The first, that it ſhould only be there; this, that only upon Appeal from the Commiſſioners it ſhould be finally Arbitrated. But leſt it ſhould be thought to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vexatious, the party Appellant muſt lay</hi> in depoſito, &amp;c. <hi>And if upon Hearing it goes againſt him, muſt pay double Coſts and Damages; we thought this courſe fittest for two Reaſons:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe a Suit in Chancery is too long a courſe, and the Merchant cannot indure delays.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe our Courts have not the knowledge of their Terms, neither can they tell what to ſay upon their Caſes, which be Secrets in their Science, proceeding out of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               <p>I referr the Bills, both Old and New, to your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wiſhing good Succeſs therein, both for comfort of the Merchants, and Accompliſhment of our deſires.

            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> ſaid: It was the good pleaſure of this Houſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Edward Hobby.</note> to referr the conſideration of an Information Exhibited againſt a Member of this Houſe, one of the Burgeſſes for the Town of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> viz. Mr. <hi>Bellgrave:</hi> the Scope and purpoſe of which Information, pretendeth an Abuſe to be done to this High Court.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman himſelf was at the Committee, and did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſubſtance of the Suggeſtion, but denyed the Circumſtance. Some of the Committees Cenſured it to be an Enormous fault, <hi>to inveſt himſelf</hi> (for ſo the words of the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation are) <hi>in a blew Coat:</hi> but others were of a contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, becauſe they were ſatisfied upon Allegations Alleadged, that it was done <hi>ad reducendam vexationem,</hi> which had been offer'd unto him, and ſo he thought to right himſelf this way.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I am to inform the Houſe, that this information is put in <hi>Sedente Curia,</hi> and therefore thought by the Committees ſome diſgrace to the ſame. And, becauſe this Gentleman ſhould not take benefit of this Pardon; therefore the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is now put in, as I ſaid, <hi>Sedente Curia,</hi> which I wiſh the Houſe to Note. And, becauſe he ſhould be debarred of remedy againſt the party, he hath therefore cauſed
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:107812:139"/>the ſame to be Exhibited, in Mr. <hi>Atturney-Generals</hi> name.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe the Houſe, becauſe he deſireth to be heard, and being now here, that he may ſpeak for himſelf, in that he told the Committees he had ſome ſpecial matter to deliver unto you; and if he ſhall be found Culpable, he would moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly abide your Cenſures. But becauſe ſome other Bills were to be read, of importance, this was referred over till ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time.</p>
            <p>A Bill for continuance of divers Statutes, and repeal of ſome others. Mr. <hi>Francis Moor</hi> deſired it might be read, and alſo the Expoſition of the Juſtices upon the Statute of 39. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginae</hi> concerning Rogues; which if it pleaſe the Houſe, he thought fit to be Annexed to that Statute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Bacon <hi>ſaid:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Facon</hi> ſpeaks againſt a Bill and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes it.</note> 
               <hi>There were never yet but two</hi> Articuli; <hi>the one</hi> Articuli ſuper Chartas, <hi>when the Sword ſtood in the Commons Hands; the other</hi> Articuli Cleri, <hi>when the Clergy of the Land bare ſway, and that done upon deliberation and grave adviſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I beſeech you remember, theſe are done by Judges, and privately, and perhaps in a Chamber. And ſhall we without ſcanning, or view, Enact them? It befits not the Gravity of this Houſe.</hi> And ſo after a long ſpeech, daſhed it.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Stanhop</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cary,</hi> brought a Bill from the Lords, Intituled, <hi>An Act for the more Peaceable Government of the parts of</hi> Cumberland, Northumberland, Weſtmorland, <hi>and the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of</hi> Durham.</p>
            <p>A Bill to prevent the double-payment of Debts, ſent up to the Lords by Mr. <hi>Comptroller</hi> and others. And a deſire withall, to have a conference with ſome few Touching the Bill ſent from them of <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Dunſden,</hi> to be re-united to the Mannor of <hi>Sunning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cauſe of this Conference, came from a Motion made by Mr. Serj. <hi>Harris,</hi> who ſaid, That for ſome eſpecial cauſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, it was deſired (which I learned after what it was, by Mr. <hi>Fettyplace</hi> Burgeſs of <hi>London</hi>) that there was an admitting of all Aſſurances; ſo the <hi>Londoners</hi> barred of their right, which they had, by reaſon this <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Dunſden</hi> were part of the Land aſſured to the City of <hi>London</hi> for the Loan of Twenty Thouſand Pounds Lent to the Queen, to be repaid at a certain time. And, if this Act ſhould thus paſs, they were barred.</p>
            <p>The Lords returned word, That Ten of them would meet. And ſo Twelve of our Houſe were Choſen to meet them, to Morrow in the afternoon.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bacon,</hi>

And the Lord Keeper, having told him, that he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:107812:139"/>but one decree of the Commiſſioners, we ſhould do a moſt Uncharitable Action to repeal and ſubvert ſuch a mount of Charity; and therefore ſaid, <hi>That we ſhould rather tenderly foſter it, then roughly cry, away with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpeak (quoth he) Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> even out of the ſtrings of my Heart, which doth Alter my ordinary Form of ſpeech; for I ſpeak not now out of the Fervency of my Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So he ſpake ſomthing more againſt the Bill, put in by Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> for Repeal, by reaſon Biſhops Lands were put in, and Inrolments, which he ſaid, was a good Fetch and Policy for the ſole practices of the Chancery.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> anſwered,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Bacon.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q rend="inline">That he would not ſpeak as he had ſpoken, rather out of Humor than out of Judgment; neither had he brought to the Houſe a Market-Bill, or Mercers Bill concerning the State. And ſo after many perſwaſions for the Bill, and bitter Anſwers to Mr. <hi>Bacon,</hi> he ended with a deſire, to put it to the Queſtion, whether it ſhould be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by the publique Act, or his private Bill.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> moved, That the Queſtion might be, Whether it ſhould be as well in the General Law, as the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Glaſcock</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Glaſcock <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> Philips.</note> 
               <q rend="inline">I think the Gentleman that laſt ſpake (Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> a ſurveyor) hath better Skill in Meaſuring of Land, than Mens Conſciences.

            </p>
            <p>So after long diſpute, till almoſt one of the Clock, it was put to the Queſtion, Whether it ſhall be Repealed by the General Law of repeal, and continuance of Statutes. And the moſt voices were <hi>I, I, I,</hi> and ſo it was Agreed.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday, December</hi> the 8th,<note place="margin">A Bill to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Ordnance.</note> An Act prohibiting the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation of Iron Ordnance beyond the Seas, by way of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, was Read.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Edward Hobby.</note> I may reſemble this Bill to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who told a Story of a Skilful <hi>Painter,</hi> who had Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Tree ſtanding in the midſt of the Sea; and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another Skilful <hi>Painter</hi> being asked, his Anſwer was, <hi>Valde bene ſed hic non erat Locus.</hi> So I ſay this Bill, is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Bill, the matter Foul, the requeſt and remedy Good and Honeſt; but this is not our mean of Redreſs.</p>
               <p>Her Majeſty, in the late Proclamation, took notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and no doubt but ſhe will Redreſs it. And for us now, to enter again, in bringing in, or allowing Bills againſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies, it is to refuſe Her Majeſties Gracious Favor, and Cleave to our own affections.</p>
               <p>I think therefore, if we will be dealing herein, by Petition will be our only Courſe; this is a matter of Prerogative, and this no place to diſpute it.</p>

            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Fettyplace</hi> ſaid: I know Her Majeſty receiveth yearly by Cuſtom, for the Tranſportation of theſe Ordnance, <hi>Three Thouſand Pounds</hi> by the Year; there be four kind of Ordnance now uſually Tranſported:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Fetty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place</hi> to the ſame Bill.</note> The firſt, a <hi>Faulcon,</hi> of the leaſt Weight and Bore. The ſecond, a <hi>Minnion,</hi> a little heavier, and of a bigger Bore. The third, a <hi>Saker,</hi> of ſomewhat a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bore. And the fourth, a <hi>Demy-Culvering,</hi> being of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bore.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> they that do Tranſport Ordnance, do Tranſport in this manner: If it be a <hi>Faulcon,</hi> She ſhall have the weight of a <hi>Minnion;</hi> and ſo if a <hi>Saker,</hi> the weight of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-Culvering;</hi> the Reaſon thereof is, Becauſe when they are brought beyond Sea, they will there new bore them to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſize; as, the <hi>Saker</hi> to the <hi>Demi-Culvering</hi>-Bore.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Eight Tun of Iron Ordnance, will make five Tuns of good Iron.</p>
               <p>But perchance, it will be Objected, That if we Reſtrain the Tranſportation of Iron Ordnance, they will uſe Braſs.</p>
               <p>I ſay, under Favour, That they cannot, becauſe they want Braſs.</p>
               <p>And again, where you may furniſh a Ship for 200. or 300. <hi>Pounds</hi> with Iron Ordnance, you cannot furniſh Her with Braſs Ordnance for 1400. <hi>Pounds.</hi> And it is now grown ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that if you would ſend Merchandiſe beyond the Seas in ſtrangers Bottoms, they will not carry them, unleſs you will ballaſt their Ships with ſome Ordnance.</p>
               <p>The Ordnance be carried to <hi>Callis, Breſt, Embden, Lubeck, Rochel,</hi> and other places. All theſe be Confederates with <hi>Spain,</hi> and friends with <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> So that in helping them, we do not only hurt our <hi>Friends,</hi> but ſuccour the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> their Friends, and our Enemies.</p>
               <p>If the Queen, would but forbid the Tranſportation of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for ſeven years, it would breed ſuch a Scarcity of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that we might have him where we would: ſome in that time, no doubt, the Sea would devour; ſome would be taken, and the Store which he now hath, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and thereby his Force weakned. They have ſo many Iron Ordnance in <hi>Spain</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> that they do ordinarily ſell a 100. weight of Iron Ordnance, for ſeven Duckets and an half, <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> And if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> do make it a Capital mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but to Tranſport an Horſe or a Gennet, much more ought we to have ſpecial Care herein, when we ſhall hereby Arm our Enemies againſt our ſelves.</p>
               <p>I think therefore, to proceed by way of Bill, would favour of Curbing Her Majeſties Prerogative: but to proceed by way of Petition, it is a ſafe Courſe, and pleaſing; and we ought the rather to be induced thereunto, becauſe we have already found it Succeſsful.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> the Lawyer ſaid: There is a Law already in the point.

               <p>But it was lately adjudged, in <hi>Worlington</hi> and <hi>Symon</hi>'s Caſe, to be clearly within the very Letter of the Law. And I am ſure, Guns are made of Gun-metal; and whoſoever Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Guns, tranſports Gun-metal, and it is within the danger of the Law.</p>
               <p>But that which I would move, is, only this; That we might be Petitioners to Her Majeſty to revoke that Patent: And then <hi>Currat Lex.</hi>

               <q rend="inline">I am ſure heretofore one Ship of Her Majeſties, was able to beat twenty <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but now by reaſon of our own Ordnance, we are hardly matched one to one. And if the Low-Countries ſhould either be ſubdued by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or yeild unto him, upon a conditional Peace, or ſhall joyn in Amity with the <hi>French,</hi> as we ſee them dayly inclining, I ſay there is nothing ſo much threatens the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of this Kingdom, or more, than the Tranſportation of Ordnance. And therefore, I think it a good and ſpeedy courſe, to proceed by way of Petition, leſt we be cut off from our deſires, either by the Upper Houſe, or before, by the ſhort and ſuddain ending of the Parliament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> for the ſame by Bill.</note> 
               <q rend="inline">We take it for an Uſe in the Houſe, That when any great and weighty Matter, or Bill is here handled, we ſtraight-ways ſay, <hi>It toucheth the Prerogative,</hi> and that muſt not be medled withal; and ſo, that we that come here to do our Countries Good, bereave them of that good help we may juſtly Adminiſter unto them.</q>

               <hi>Mr.</hi> Speaker, <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Qui vadit planè, vadit Sanè:</hi> Let us lay down our Griefs in the Preamble of the Bill, and make it by way of Petition, and, I doubt not, but Her Majeſty, being truly informed of it, will give her Royal Aſſent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Secretary Herbert</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">The making of <hi>Armentaria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Herbert</hi> for proceeding by Petition, to prohibit Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> is a Regality, only belonging to the Power of the King and Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore no man can either Caſt, or Tranſport without Licenſe. It ſtood perhaps with the Policy of former times, to ſuffer Tranſportation: But as the times alter, ſo doth the Government; and now, no doubt, but it is very hurtful and pernitious to the State. And therefore, I am of Opinion, That it is very fit this Tranſportation ſhould be ſtaid. And I concur only with them, which would have it by way of Petition, and not by Bill.</q>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Hackwell.</note> I know the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the worthy Councellor that laſt ſpake, will ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate your Cenſures to yeild to his Objection: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I beſeech you, to ſuppoſe him to be a man of my Condition, or me to be a man of his Sort; ſo I doubt not but, our Perſons being equalized, the matter will ſoon be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</p>

               <p>Where he ſaith, Tranſportation is neceſſary to aid our Friends, and retain their Alliance. I Anſwer, this is the Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Covetouſneſs of our Friends, who finding the Ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Gain and Treaſure they get by Ordnance brought from us, do not only deſire them for Gain, but alſo, to gain to themſelves Confederates, by which means Succouring our Friends, we Aid our Enemies. For look whatſoever we give them, we deduct from our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now, let us ſtop this Tranſportation of Ordnance, and that greatly weakens their Forces, by which means, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to incounter us hand to hand. Our Ordnance, that precious Jewel of this Realm, (even worth all we have) is familiarly ſold in the Countries of our Confederates, as any thing within this Land; but this being ſtopped, they will be forced to take Supply from their Ports to their Ships; from their Ships to the Field, and from the Field to other places.</p>

For us then to deal in a matter ſo highly touching Her Prerogative, we ſhall not only give her Majeſty juſt Cauſe of Offence, but juſt cauſe to Deny our Proceeding by Bill.</p>
               <p>I think, therefore, by laying open our Griefs in a Petition, it will move Her Majeſty as much, being a Caſe of this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as our firſt Motion by Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> hath done. And therefore, I am of Opinion, there is no way but this for our ſafety.</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>George Moore</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Sir <hi>George Moore</hi> for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</note> It is a vain thing to Diſpute of the <q rend="inline">matter, when the manner only is in queſtion: and as vain to loſe the matter by our long Diſpute of the manner. The late Experience of Her Majeſty's Love and Clemency towards us, and Care over us, ſtriketh ſuch an awful Regard into my Heart, I wholly diſlike this Proceeding by Bill, and do only Approve of the former motion, by way of Petition.</q>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Laurence Hide</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Laurence Hide</hi> is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by Bill in it.</note> 
               <q rend="inline">It is doubted by ſome, this Bill will not Paſs, by reaſon of the ſuddain ending of the Parliament: For that I think, if we give not too much ſcope to private Bills, This Bill would quickly Paſs; and I ſee no Reaſon, but we may proceed by Bill, and not touch Her Majeſties Prerogative; For Her Majeſty is not more careful and watchful of Her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, than the Noble Prince, King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. Her Father, and King <hi>Edward</hi> 6. Her Brother, were: Then there was no doubt nor mention made of Prerogative. And therefore I think our ſoundeſt and ſureſt Courſe is by way of Bill.</q>

            </p>
            <q>

               <p>True it is, there is an Information Exhibited againſt me in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> by the procurement of an Honourable Perſon of the Upper Houſe, (the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi>) in the Name of Mr. <hi>Atturney-General,</hi> for a Miſdemeanor Committed to this Court.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of that Information I do Confeſs, yet I am to be an humble Suitor to this Houſe, to underſtand, Whether an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is to be Exhibited (this Houſe ſitting) againſt any Member thereof?

            </q>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Moore</hi> viewing the Information, ſaid:<note place="margin">Sir <hi>George Moore</hi> deſires there may be a Conference.</note> 
               <q rend="inline">I find the words thereof to be againſt the High Court of Parliament, which is as well the Upper-Houſe, as this Houſe.

For this Houſe is but Part, and a Member of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and therefore we ſolely cannot Proceed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Serjeant Harris</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Serjeant <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> oppoſes it.</note>

                  <hi>Id poſſimus quod Jure poſſimus;</hi> and therefore, reſting in doubt herein, the ſafeſt courſe is a Conference.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Tate</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">It is not good to utter ſuddain Thoughts in great matters; Our Diſpute may ſeem to have this end, either to Incur the danger of our Priviledges, by not regarding this Cauſe; or, to pry too neer into Her Majeſties Prerogative, by Examining Informations exhibited into the <hi>Star-Chamber;</hi> wherefore I think we ought to be Petitioners, (<hi>not verbum</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners) or at leaſt, to ſhew our Grieſs to the Lords. And if by an Order from them, as was alledged, this Information was put in, methinks, in Reaſon, a Conference were good, to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Cauſe, and inform this Houſe truly thereof.</q>

               <p>I know Mr. <hi>Belgrave</hi> wrote his Letter to my Lord, and that it pleaſed his Honour to anſwer him: and that he offered to follow his Honour in that ſort, as is fitting for a Gentleman of his Worth: and rather His Honour, than any mans in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, I take it, may ſatisfy the Houſe for Anſwer to the firſt part of the Information, which containeth a Diſhonour offered to the Earl.</p>
               <p>For the Second, which is, Deceiving of the Burgeſſes: I do aſſure this Houſe, they were both willing and worthy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. I know they had given their Voices, and deſired Mr. <hi>Bellgrave</hi> to undertake it.</p>
               <p>For the Wrong to this Court, I hope this Court hath wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom enough to Right it ſelf, without any Courſe in the <hi>Star-Chamber:</hi> yet by your Favours, I may ſay thus much. That if we ſhould Puniſh him for coming Indirectly to this Place, we ſhould Puniſh three parts of the Houſe; for none ought to be Choſen, but thoſe that be reſident and ſworn Burgeſſes of the Town.</p>

               <p>I wiſh a Conference may be had with the Lords, becauſe the matter may be brought to ſome friendly end; For God knows what may lie in the Deck after the Parliament, and I ſuſpect it the more, becauſe the Information is filed, and no <hi>Proceſs</hi> ſued out.</p>

               <p>The Conference with the Lords, muſt conſiſt of two points. Firſt, Touching an offence Committed by Mr. <hi>Bellgrave;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the Infringing of the Liberty of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt, that the Commons would do nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:107812:143"/>until a Conference with them. For the Second, to know the reaſon of their Lordſhips appointment of the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to bring it to ſome end. The Houſe agreed to the points, and allowed of them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>A Bill for the more peaceable Government of the Counties of <hi>Northumberland, Cumberland, Weſtmorland,</hi> and the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Durham;</hi> the firſt Reading.</p>
            <p>The points to be conſider'd of, in the continuance of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, were read, and offer'd ſtill to diſpute, whether the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Tillage ſhould be continued.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">In the time of Dearth when we made this Statute, it was not conſider'd,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> about the Statute for Tillage to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</note> that the hand of God was upon us. And now Corn is Cheap, and if too Cheap, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band man is undone, whom we muſt provide for; for he is the Staple-man of the Kingdom, and ſo, after many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he concluded it was fit to be Repealed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">The Old commendation of <hi>Italy</hi> by the Poet,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> oppoſes it.</note> is, <hi>Potens viris at<expan>

And, if you will put in ſo many Proviſoes as he deſired, you will make ſo great a window out of the Law, that we ſhall put the Law out of the Window. The Husband-Man is a ſtrong and hardy Man, the good Foot-man, which is a Chief obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good Warriours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So he concluded, the Statute was not to be Repealed.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> ſaid: I think this Law fit to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</note> for many poor men are not able to find Seed to Sow ſo much Ground as they are bound to Plow, which they muſt do; or incur the Penalty of the Statute.</p>
               <p>Beſides, all Nations abound with Corn: <hi>France</hi> offer'd the Queen to ſerve <hi>Ireland</hi> with Corn at Sixteen Shillings a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is but Two Shillings a Buſhel; if we ſhould ſell it ſo here, the Plow-Man would be beggar'd. The <hi>Low-Country-Man</hi> and the <hi>Hollander,</hi> who never Sow Corn, have by their induſtry ſuch Plenty, that they will ſerve other Nations. The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that often wanteth Corn, had we never ſo much Plenty, would never be beholding to the <hi>Engliſh-Man</hi> for it, neither to the <hi>Low-Country-Man;</hi> nor to <hi>France;</hi> but will fetch it even of the very <hi>Barbarian.</hi> And that which the <hi>Barbarian</hi> hath been ſueing for theſe 200 Years (I mean for Traficque of Corn into <hi>Spain</hi>) this King in Policy hath ſet at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of himſelf, becauſe he will not be beholding unto other Nations. And therefore I think the beſt Courſe is, to ſet it at Liberty, and leave every man Free, which is the Deſire of a true <hi>Engliſhman.</hi>

            </q>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid: I do not dwell in the Country,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Secretary Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary mind.</note> nor am I acquainted with the Plough. But I think that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth not maintain the Plough, deſtroys the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>There was the laſt Parliament, great Arguments on this
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:107812:144"/>Point, and after a deliberate Diſputation, the Paſſing of this Bill was concluded.</p>
               <p>My Motion therefore ſhall be, That this Law may not be Repealed, except former Laws may be in Force and Revived. Say, that a Glut of Corn ſhould be: Have we not a ſufficient remedy by Tranſportation, which is allowed by the Policy of all Nations? I cannot be induced or drawn from this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, upon Government of Foreign States; I am ſure, when Warrants go from the Councel, for levying of men in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and the Certificates be returned to us again, we find the greateſt part of them to be Plow-men. And excepting Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Moore's Utopia,</hi> or ſome ſuch fained Common-wealth, you ſhall never find, but the Plow-man is chiefly provided for; the neglect whereof, will not only bring a general, but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular indempnity to every man.</p>
               <p>If, in <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. his time, a Law was made for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Fry of <hi>Fiſh;</hi> and in <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. time, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the <hi>Eggs</hi> of wild Foul, ſhall we now throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Law of more Conſequence and Import? If we debar Tillage, we give ſcope to the depopulator; and then if the poor, being thruſt out of their Houſes, go to dwell with others, ſtraight we catch them with the Statute of Inmates. If they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der abroad, and be ſtubborn, they are within the danger of the Statute of Rogues. If they be more humble and urgent Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, then are they within the Statute of the poor to be Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and Tormented: So by this means, undo this Statute, and you indanger many Thouſands. <hi>Poſterior dies diſcipulus prioris.</hi> If former times have made us wiſe to make a Law, let theſe latter times warn us to preſerve ſuch a good Law. All that I can ſay is, this Policy, Nature, Charity, and Honour, do deſire of theſe Proceedings in Charitable uſes.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Selby</hi> deſired, that the County of <hi>Northumberland</hi> might be exempted out of the Statute, becauſe it was ſo nigh the <hi>Scots;</hi> and the Country was ſo infeſted with the Plague, that, not only whole Families, but whole Villages have been ſwept away with that Calamity. And ſo he made a long Speech to that effect.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Serjeant Yelverton;</hi> and Doctor <hi>Cary</hi> came from the Lords, to deſire that the Conference touching <hi>Letters Patents</hi> might be prolonged, until <hi>Friday</hi> Morning at eight of the Clock, which was Aſſented unto.</p>
            <p>It was put to the Queſtion, whether the Bill for Tillage ſhould be Committed? And moſt ſaid, <hi>I, I, I.</hi> Then whether <hi>Northumberland</hi> ſhould be exempted upon Mr. <hi>Selbies</hi> Motion? And all ſaid, <hi>I, I, I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another matter which the Committees for the continuance of Statutes doubted of, was, whether Mr. <hi>Dormer's</hi> Proviſo ſhould be put into the Bill for Tillage.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">May it pleaſe you, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-man is at the Door (Mr <hi>Dormer</hi> by Name) ready to attend with his Councel, to ſatisfy the Houſe; and Prayed, they might be admitted; and all ſaid, <hi>I, I, I.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dodderige</hi> of Councel, with Mr. <hi>Dormer,</hi> ſaid: Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:107812:144"/>It pleaſed Her Majeſty to Licenſe Mr. <hi>Dormer</hi> under Her <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Pattents,</hi> with a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> this Statute, to incloſe 300 Acres of Ground. And he humbly prayeth the Houſe, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and admit of this Proviſo; for the Saving of his <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> the rather for theſe Reaſons:
<list>
                     <item>1. In reſpect the Ground incloſed, is a ſmall quantity.</item>
                     <item>2. The Country is apt for Paſture, and not for Tillage.</item>
                     <item>3. This ground is a kind of Mariſh ground, and too moyſt and ſoft, and altogether unfit for Tillage.</item>
                     <item>4. In that Her Majeſty hath granted her <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> &amp; that they concern Her Prerogative. So he delivered the Proviſo, and Mr. <hi>Dormer</hi> his <hi>Letters Pattents,</hi> and went forth.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Serjeant Harris</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Ubi non eſt ordo, ibi eſt Confuſio;</hi> Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> divers Gentleman ſtand before the Door, which breeds a confuſed Sound when the queſtion is propounded. May it pleaſe you, that every man take his place. This is both ſeemly, and the Ancient Cuſtom; which they all did.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">I will put it to the Queſtion, whether this Proviſo of Mr. <hi>Dormer's</hi> ſhall be received. It was put to the Queſtion twice, and in my Conſcience, the <hi>I, I, I,</hi> were the greater number: But the <hi>Noes, Noes,</hi> would needs have the Houſe divided. So the door being ſet open, no man offered to go forth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Martyn</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I have obſerved it, that ever, this Parliament, the <hi>Noes</hi> upon the diviſion of the Houſe have carried it; the Reaſon whereof, as I conceive it, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe divers are loth to go forth for Fear of loſing their Places; and many that cry <hi>I, I, I,</hi> will ſit ſtill with the <hi>Noes.</hi> I therefore do but move this unto the Houſe, that all thoſe that have given their <hi>I, I, I,</hi> would according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, go forth. And for my part, I'le begin. And ſo went forth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> roſe up to Anſwer him, but Mr. <hi>Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller,</hi> Sir <hi>John Forteſcue,</hi> and all the Houſe ſeeing them, Roſe up in a Hurry to go forth, and did not hear him. Whereupon, himſelf and Mr. <hi>Secretary,</hi> it ſeemed, and they of the <hi>Noes,</hi> took ſome diſpleaſure, as may appear by the Speech after. The <hi>I, I, I,</hi> were 178. and the <hi>Noes</hi> 134. ſo the <hi>I, I, I,</hi> got it 44 Voices. And after the Houſe was quiet.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Secretary Cecil</hi> ſaid: I am glad to ſee the Parliament ſo full, which uſed, towards the end, to grow thin.<note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Cecil's</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Houſe.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it convenient we agree of ſome good Orders.</p>
               <p>The Reputation of this Houſe hath ever been Religiouſly maintained, by Order and Government; but now Error hath ſo crept in amongſt us, that we know not what is Order, what Diſorder.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman that laſt ſpake (meaning Mr. <hi>Martin</hi>) firſt brake Order; for after the Queſtion put, and the Houſe agreed to be divided, he ſpake perſwadingly to draw thoſe out of the Houſe who perhaps meant it not.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:107812:145"/>
               <p>Beſides, he laid an Imputation upon the Houſe, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Conſciences, men would not ſo much as remove out of their places: But I think there is no man here that is ſo Fantaſtical, that though they be for the Bill, yet for their Places ſake, they will not alter their Rooms: For this Houſe is a Houſe of Gravity, Conſcience, and Religion.</p>
               <p>I think it therefore fit, he ſhould anſwer this Imputation at the Bar; we have all this Parliament, been againſt <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies,</hi> and now we our ſelves Protect one: But I ſee that men that have deſired to be Popular, without the Houſe, for ſpeaking againſt <hi>Monopolies,</hi> do alſo labour to be private within; but that I regard not. This I know, that good ſums of mony have been profer'd for the furtherance of this Proviſo.</p>
               <p>But now it is paſt, I would now move you, That becauſe we have ſpent ſome ſuperfluous time in this diviſion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Affairs of this Parliament cannot poſſibly be diſpatched, ſo ſoon as the Parliament muſt end, becauſe of the performance of that Gift we have given her Majeſty, which is nothing, if it comes not in due time.</p>
               <p>Therefore, that the Houſe would be pleaſed after this day, to Sit in the Afternoons, for we conſume our beſt time now in unneceſſary Diſputation.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Comptroller</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>'s Reply to <hi>Cecil.</hi>
                  </note> I think that notwithſtanding any thing that hath been laſt ſaid, However our Orders have been heretofore broken, yet the Gentleman that ſpake (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Martyn</hi>) brake no Order of the Houſe, by ſpeaking: For the Houſe favour'd him with Silence, and therefore admitted to him liberty of Speech.</p>
               <p>I hat his Speech was either Perſwaſive, or offer'd any Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Houſe, I neither perceive it, or conceive it ſo; for it was only a Caution to the Houſe, that former Orders were broken, and therefore now to be remedied and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And ſurely, for not removing out of Places, I have heard fault found before this time, and therefore the Gentleman is not now to be taxed.</p>
               <p>That this ſhould be a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> I can ſee no Reaſon: For it hath been agreed, that Her Majeſty may diſpence with any penal Law; and that is no <hi>Monopoly,</hi> no more is this. And I am not of his mind, that ſo great ſums of money have been offer'd, the quantity of Land being but little, and his Cauſe both good and juſt.</p>
               <p>And for my part, I do proteſt, I neither knew nor have heard of any. For the laſt part of his Motion, which was the beſt, to ſit twice a day, I do concur with him; and will be ready, as a Member of this Houſe, to give my Attendance.</p>

               <q rend="inline">I thought I had deſerved of the Houſe, to have been heard to ſpeak, as well as he that ſpake before the Diviſion. And in that I offer'd to ſpeak, and was not heard, I had Wrong. For him that laſt ſpake out of Humour, and not out of Judgment, notwithſtanding, I think it to be a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> and the Speech to be both Perſwaſive, and to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:107812:145"/>lay a great Imputation upon the Houſe. And this is all I would have ſaid before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Martyn</hi> offer'd to ſpeak, and Asked the Speaker, <hi>If he might Anſwer?</hi> The Houſe cried, <hi>I, I, I. No</hi> (quoth the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary) <hi>you muſt ſtand at the Bar.</hi> And the Houſe cried <hi>No, No, No.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Secretary</hi> deſired, it might be put to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether he ſhould ſpeak or No? And ſo it was, and not <hi>Twenty</hi> ſaid <hi>No.</hi> Then it was put to the Queſtion, Whether he ſhould ſpeak at the Bar, or No? And Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> the Lawyer ſtood up and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Speaker, Par in Parem non habet Imperium,</hi> we are all Members of one Body, and One cannot Judg of Another.</p>
            <p>So being put to the Queſtion, there were not above twelve <hi>I, I, I,</hi> that he ſhould ſtand at the Bar.</p>
            <p>Whereupon Mr. <hi>Martyn</hi> ſtanding in his Seat, ſhewed the Cauſe of his Speech to have been, only for the Order of the Houſe, and not out of any Perſwaſive meaning that he had; For he proteſted, he neither knew the Man, nor the Matter.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday Decemb.</hi> the <hi>Tenth,</hi> A Bill for the Denization of certain Perſons, <hi>viz. Joſepho Lupo,</hi> and others, was Read: And becauſe the ſaid <hi>Joſepho Lupo</hi> had neither Father nor Mother <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Houſe reſpited the Bill.</p>

            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Serj.

            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">We attended the Lords this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, touching the Information againſt Mr. <hi>Belgrave;</hi> and in the end concluded, That foraſmuch as it concerneth Their as well as Our Privileges, they deſire ſome time to Conſult; and then will ſend us word of their Reſolutions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Stanhop,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hone,</hi> brought a Bill from the Lords; Intituled, <hi>An Act for the Stabliſhment of the Remainder of certain Lands of</hi> Andrew Ketleby Eſquire, <hi>to</hi> Francis Ketleby. And ſo they departed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Spicer</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">If I ſhould not agree to the Subſtance of the Bill, I were no good Commonwealths-man And if I ſhould agree to the Form, I ſhould ſcarce think my ſelf a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; for I may juſtly ſay of this Bill, <hi>Nihil eſt ubi error non eſt.</hi>

            <pb n="305" facs="tcp:107812:146"/>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Serjeant Harris</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">If this Bill ſhould paſs, as was well ſaid, we all ſhould loſe the Liberties of our Corporations: And Her Majeſties Juſtices at the Seſſions,<note place="margin">Serj. <hi>Harris</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</note> ſhould be troubled with Brables of Ale-Houſes.

                  <hi>Wines</hi> heretofore have been at <hi>Ten Pound</hi> a Tun; and the Laws are, That <hi>Wines</hi> ſhould be ſold at <hi>Two Pence</hi> the Quart, and Her Majeſty Receiveth <hi>One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Six Hundred Pounds</hi> a Year Cuſtom for them. If now this Statute ſhould ſtand, that Four Juſtices ſhould Licenſe the ſale of <hi>Wines,</hi> this would be a wrong to divers Licenſes, which are made by Pattentees of her Majeſty, and a beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all <hi>Vintners.</hi> And he that now keeps an Inn; if he pleaſes not the Juſtices, he ſhall be turned out. And withal, there is a Clauſe of diſability, which is moſt grievous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Wroth</hi> ſaid: <hi>It ſeemes the Houſe doth diſtaſt this Bill, <q rend="inline">and</q> I doubt of the Paſſing of it. I would but move the Houſe to remember, That it is an Ancient Cuſtom, that for Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſake to the Lords of the Upper-Houſe, we only deny the Bill a Commitment, and ſo let it lye in the Deck, and not put it to the Queſtion for Ingroſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Sir <hi>George Moore</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Sir <hi>George Moore</hi> againſt it.</note> I will be bold to give my Reaſon, and leave the Conſideration thereof unto you. I wiſh it might be Committed; for, for ought I hear yet, a Proviſo might help all.</p>
               <p>The Old Statute is, <hi>The next Juſtice;</hi> this is, <hi>The Juſtices of the Quarter-Seſſions.</hi> It is intended, that all Juſtices every Quarter-Seſſions give their Attendance. There have been oftentimes Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from her Majeſties Privy-Council, and Orders from Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty her ſelf, who looketh down with a gracious Eye upon the Meaneſt of Her Subjects, touching theſe Ale-Houſe-Keepers.</p>
               <p>Therefore I wiſh, That we do not caſt it forth, but give it the ordinary and due Conſideration of other Bills, by way of Commitment.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſaid: I am very Reſpectful of the Place from whence this Bill cometh; if the Parliament be ſhort, as ther's no other likely-hood; and time ſo pretious with us, that we Sit in the Afternoons: and this Bill Incurable, and not to be mended; and the former Laws ſo Politique, that I think we ſhall not make a better: for my part I think it needleſs to be Committed, but to be put to the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>For the Point, that Four Juſtices of the Peace ſhould Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by this Statute, though they deſerve to be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; yet there is no Power limited of Suppreſſion. Beſides, there is a Statute that <hi>Badgers</hi> and <hi>Loaders</hi> ſhall be Licenſed under — Juſtices hands in the Quarter-Seſſions. I know my ſelf, that even when the Juſtices are going out of Town, and even ready to take Horſe, the Clerk of the Peace will bring 40. or 50. to be ſigned by one: and then another, he ſtraight
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:107812:147"/>puts to his hand, becauſe he will not ſtay; and knows no more of the Man, or the Matter, than he that never read them. And ſo would this Statute, if it ſhould go forwards, be Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bond</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bond</hi> moves for a Proviſo.</note> 'If this Act paſs for a Law, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any exceptions that have been taken; I humbly deſire you all, that one Proviſo may be put in, and that is; That no Retainer or Servant to a Juſtice of Peace, be admitted to be an <hi>Ale-houſe-Keeper, Vintner</hi> or <hi>Victualler;</hi> unleſs he ſhall be Choſen by a Jury of Twelve Men at the <hi>Leet,</hi> or <hi>Law-day</hi> of that Burrough-Town, wherein he deſireth to <hi>Victual.</hi> I know, and ſpeak what I know very well, that more diſorder, and more Miſrule is uſually kept in the Houſes of ſuch kind of men, than in all the Country beſides, if this ſtand not for a Law, order may be taken for ſuch kind of Offences.</p>
               <p>The Law before, alloweth two Juſtices, I wiſh theſe Protecting Juſtices may not have the ſame Power; for as ſome be Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, ſo they are men. I know many Abuſes touching Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given to men that be Tipplers. I am a <hi>Devonſhire</hi>-man, and I ſpeak plainly from the Heart of him that hates Popery, and defies Puritaniſm.

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I know what I ſpeak, and I have Reaſon to ſpeak thus, by Reaſon of ſome Imputation that hath been Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd me by one whom in Charity, I Pray God Forgive.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Martyn</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Martyn</hi> for putting it to the Queſtion.</note> 
               <q rend="inline">The Gentleman that laſt ſpake, it ſeems ſpake out of his Grief of mind in being galled by ſome Tongue-me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. And I think there is no man that feeleth blowes, but would be glad to be eaſed of them. I cannot therefore blame him to purge and defend himſelf by this Apology. But that hath led us out of the Ale-houſe. Yet I wiſh that we might make a quick Return, by putting it, without further Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the queſtion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So it was put to the Queſtion,<note place="margin">It is Rejected</note> whether it ſhould be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and all ſaid <hi>No, No,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Wingfield,</hi> at which the Houſe Laughed.</p>
            <p>Then the Queſtions upon the continuance of Statutes, were offer'd to be Read.<note place="margin">The Bill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corning Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance called for.</note> But the Houſe called for the Bill concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ordnance: yet the Clerk fell to Read the Queſtions, but ſtill the Houſe cried, <hi>Upon the Bill for Ordnance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length, Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> ſtood up and ſaid:<note place="margin">In Whom it lies to chuſe what <hi>Bill</hi> ſhall be Read.</note> In the <hi>Roman Senate,</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Comptroller</hi> ſtood up and ſaid:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> ſpeaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Diſorders.</note> 
               <q rend="inline">I am ſorry to ſee this Confuſion in this Houſe. It were better we uſed more Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſpake in Order.

            </p>
            <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">I will ſpeak ſhortly,<note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> Compoſes it.</note> becauſe it beſt becomes me; neither will I trouble your Patience long, becauſe the time permits it not.

            </p>
            <p>The Bill againſt Tranſportation of Iron-Ordnance, Gun-me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, 'and Shot, was Read; And</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Wroth</hi> Informed the Houſe, <hi>That a Ship is now upon the River, ready to go away Laden with</hi> Thirty Six <hi>peeces of Ordnance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was put to the Queſtion, Whether the Statute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Poor ſhould be continued, and all cried <hi>I, I, I.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Secr. <hi>Cecil</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Maimed Souldiers.</note> I am ſorry that I have ſo great Occaſion to Recommend to the Houſes Conſideration the miſerable eſtate of Maimed Souldiers.</p>
               <p>War is a Curſe to all People, and eſpecially the poor Creatures that come from the Warrs Poor, Friendleſs, and Unhappy. I am glad you are reſolved this Statute ſhall be kept alive; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in ſome meaſure, thoſe poor maimed Souls ſhall be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for; For, both Religion and Charity willeth us to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Conſideration of Amendment.</p>
               <p>I do not this out of Popularity, becauſe I have been often times taxed by the men of War, and more than any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>England.</hi> For when I have ſeen Souldiers deceived by their Captains, I have taxed them for it, and that makes me odious unto them. A Captain is a man of Note, and able to keep himſelf: but a Souldier is not.</p>
               <p>I wiſh not any to think, that I do ſpeak of all Captains, for I make a difference between the Corn, and the Chaff. The Statute is is, That the poor Souldier muſt be Relieved, either by the Country where he was Born, or out of which he was
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:107812:148"/>Preſſed: But if that were amended, and only to be relieved in the Country where he was Born, this would yield a more certainty and greater Relief. For in a mans Country, either Charity, Kindred, or Commiſeration will breed Pity: But out of the Country, where he was Preſt, that cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. For the multitude preſt out of ſome little Shire, grows to be greater, and the Charge more than in ſome other three Shires. As in <hi>London,</hi> where there be many Pariſhes, infinite Houſholds, and Numbers Preſt: Beſides, there be divers Shires ſubject to great Levies, and the diviſion ſo ſmall, that it is a meer trifle; as in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> in reſpect of the Vicinity to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Diſeaſe of the War is. If it may pleaſe you, that a Commitment may be had, I ſhall be ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it; at which time I will ſpeak further. And ſo a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment was appointed.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Francis Moore</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">There is a Bill for the Reducing of the two Statutes for Souldiers, into one; it hath lain in the Deck this fortnight: If it had been Read, it might have been Committed.</q>

               <q rend="inline">There was a Doubt, whether the Tax for <hi>Dover-Haven</hi> ſhould be continued by force of the Statute; the Tax is of <hi>Three Pence</hi> a Tun for the burthen of every Ship: He ſaid, That the Seamen and Merchants, for want of ſufficient maintenance, were turned to Fiſher-men. And the Fiſher-man, if he made but two Tuns of Trayn-Oyl with the Blubber of <hi>New-found-Land</hi> Fiſh, this cauſes the Ship to be Taxed for the whole Burthen; which is grievous to the Subject: Much Money hath been Levied, It comes to at leaſt <hi>One Thouſand Marks</hi> a Year, and the <hi>Haven</hi> never the better. Nay, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> it is grown into a Proverb, If a Tax be once on foot, God ſheild it continues not as <hi>Dover-Haven.</hi>

            <p>The Queſtion was in the Houſe, Whether the Fiſh-mongers of <hi>London,</hi> their Proviſo ſhould be added to the Statute of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuances.

            <q>
               <p>Mr, <hi>Fettyplace</hi> ſhewed: That the Bill was unprofitable, and not good, for many Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> It was too General, becauſe it ſpeaketh of Arts, as well Invented, as to be Invented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly:</hi> The Bill ſheweth not, That they will be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Common-wealth; and whatſoever they be, this Bill alloweth: For divers Arts have been deviſed in <hi>London,</hi> that ſhould be wrought by one Man, which could not be done heretofore with Forty; this is, ſaid he, unprofitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſetteth not many hands on work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly:</hi> It will breed Confuſion; becauſe if but a little Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made by another, a new Licence is granted to this Man. And now, if to that Addition another ſhall add, that will be <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and ſo breed Confuſion. Whereupon he Concluded, That he for his part thought fit the Bill ſhould be quaſh'd; and divers cried <hi>Away with it.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>I wiſhed, That the Bill might be Read again, and conſidered, becauſe we allowed of theſe kind of Patents once before this Parliament: Namely, in the Licence for making <hi>Tyn</hi> by Mills, out of the Old Rubbiſh in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> upon the Motion of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh;</hi> and this Bill deſired no more in effect.</p>
            <p>Next, for the Incertainty; upon Conſideration of the Bill by ſome few Committees, the ſame might be mended, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:107812:149"/>he that performed many ſpecial devices might be Inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Beſides, he that invented any Art, or Trade, it was reaſon he ſhould have ſome Privilege; becauſe it would be an Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to others. For, <hi>Nemo naſcitur Artifex,</hi> and no man could come to that Perfection upon the firſt knowledge of it, but being taught by the firſt Inventor for a Seaſon.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Propoſition of the Gentleman that laſt ſpake, did not hold in all Arts, that the work of many ſhould be done by one. For it is Profitable for the Common-wealth, if Water may be brought to every Mans Houſe for <hi>Ten Shillings</hi> Value, where it could not be done for <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> coſt, as by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-work-device at <hi>London.</hi> So, of <hi>Iron-Mills</hi> in the low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and of the <hi>Corn-Mills</hi> upon the <hi>Thames.</hi> So of ſhooting and Charging of Ordnance, and Fire Works, and the like; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of Arts, and Sciences, that can not be done by Poor; but muſt be done by Perſons Judicial and of Skill, and thoſe that have a more Natural Inclination to come to Perfection in thoſe things, than every baſe Beggar.</p>
            <p>For his laſt Propoſition, I ſaid, <hi>Non eſt Confuſio in certa Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Singy</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">The Author of the Bill perhaps, was a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Man, for he uſed the word <hi>Refiner</hi> of Arts. So, it was put to the Queſtion to be read the ſecond time; And all ſaid, <hi>No, No.</hi> But when Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> ſaid: All thoſe that will have this Bill read the ſecond time,</q> ſay, <hi>I, I, I:</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Knightly</hi> ſaid <hi>No,</hi> Aloud; at which the Houſe Laughed, and not one ſaid, <hi>I, I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Bill for Weights and Meaſures, was called for.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Doyly</hi> ſhewed, <hi>That he had the Bill, and had attended two Days, and none of the Committees would Meet; he Prayed, the Houſe would either command the Committees to Meet, or Diſcharge him of the Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a Conference betwixt the Upper-Houſe,<note place="margin">A Conference betwixt both Houſes.</note> and the Lower-Houſe in the Painted-Chamber, which was thus:</p>
            <p>Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> with the reſt of the Lower-Houſe,<note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſpeaks in the name of the Commons.</note> came to the Lords, as they were ſitting at the Table; and going to the upper-end thereof, ſaid to this effect.</p>
            <q>
               <p>That if their Lordſhips had already concluded what to do in the Bill of Patents, they then had no Commiſſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. And if they had altered the Bill in any point, with amendments, they had no Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>But if their Lordſhips had done neither, but only were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be reſolved of any doubt, which they in their Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes conceived, and would willingly thereabouts confer with them, they would moſt willingly accompliſh their deſires: for they had ſufficient Warrant from the Houſe ſo to do.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Buckhurſt,</hi> Lord <hi>Treaſurer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Lord-<hi>Treaſurer</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers him.</note> after a little Whiſpering with the Lords, anſwered, <q rend="inline">That he would not have us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupate their Judgments with a Speech both <hi>Strange, Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and <hi>Prepoſturous,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="312" facs="tcp:107812:150"/>
            <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">He could not Anſwer their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips without Order from the other Committees, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prayed they might confer together;<note place="margin">

                  </note> which was Granted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So they went forth into another Room, and there conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what Anſwer to make. And ſoon after, they returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and Mr. Secretary ſaid,</p>
            <q>
               <p>My Lords, We of the Lower-Houſe are very ſorry your Lordſhips ſhould conceive otherwiſe than well of our Speech and good Intent. Your Lordſhips termed our Speech (for ſo I may ſay, becauſe I ſpake in the behalf, and the name of all the Committees) <hi>ſtrange, improper,</hi> and <hi>preposterous.</hi> My Lords, I think it not <hi>Strange,</hi> for it is not unknown unto your Lordſhips, We be all Members of One Body, and as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without your Lordſhips, ſo your Lordſhips cannot be without Us. And when we are deſirous, it pleaſeth your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips out of your Favour, to vouchſafe Us a Conference; ſo when your Lordſhips be willing, it pleaſeth Us out of the deſire we have to be obſervant, to yield thereunto; neither have your Lordſhips been more willing to Gratify Us with your Favours, than We of the Lower-Houſe have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to further your Lordſhips Deſires, with our beſt Furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>And therefore, my Lords, it is no <hi>Strange</hi> thing to have a Conference; neither our Speech <hi>Strange,</hi> becauſe it tended to draw us to ſome particular point of Conference.</p>
               <p>For the Epitheton <hi>Improper:</hi> I am to tell your Lordſhips, That I delivered no more than I was Commanded, nor no leſs than I was Required. And therefore, by your Lordſhips Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, no cauſe it ſhould deſerve the Title of <hi>Improper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, I take it by your Lordſhips Favours, it was not <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous;</hi> For the Firſt Matter we took ſhould be handled, was the Doubts which we Imagined your Lordſhips had conceived of the Bill: And if your Lordſhips had ought elſe conceived, I thought fit to ſhew your Lordſhips, that we then came without Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>So, my Lords, I hope I have made it appear, That the Speech was neither <hi>ſtrange, improper,</hi> or <hi>prepoſterous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But We of the Lower-Houſe, who be here Committees, do beſeech your Lordſhips, that you would not conceive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of Us, than we deſerve. And your Lordſhips ſhall find Us ever ready in all Dutiful Service, as coadjuting Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one United Body, the Houſe of Parliament.</p>
            </q>
            <p>So after, withdrawing themſelves a little from the Table, the Lords Whiſpered together, and at length calling Us, the Lord <hi>Treaſurer</hi> ſaid:</p>
            <p>The Lords were ſatisfied with our Anſwer,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and were very glad they found Us ſo Conformable; by which they doubted not but we ſhould well agree for the Conference, whereby the Bill might have the better Paſſage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> anſwered: <q rend="inline">That he was very glad their Lordſhips did conceive aright of them; and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:107812:150"/>becauſe they were many, and would not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to them with multiplicity of Speeches, had choſen for their Speakers to Satisfie their Lordſhips, Mr. <hi>Bacon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bacon,</hi> &amp;c. to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> Mr. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Harris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Francis Moore,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Mountague,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Boys.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So the Lords called Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> to them; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make Objections; and Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> anſwering Mr. <hi>Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> again Objected; and Mr. Serjeant <hi>Harris,</hi> before he had fully ended, began to anſwer. To which, Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> ſaid: <hi>Nay, Good Mr.</hi> Serjeant, <hi>Leap not over the Stile, before you come at it: Hear me out I pray you, and conceive me aright.</hi> So when he had done, Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> Anſwered:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I beſeech your Lordſhips to hear me, and that I may anſwer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out check or Controul, which I little Reſpect, becauſe it is as light, as Mr.</hi> Attorney's <hi>Arguments.</hi> And ſo he proceeded to anſwer. So the Conference brake up untill the next Morning, at which time the Lords ſaid: <hi>They would ſend us word when they were ready.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Afternoon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Bill for the Relief of <hi>Theophilus Adams,</hi> Touching certain Obligations ſuppoſed to be made void, by a Proviſo contained in the Statute 39. <hi>Reginae cap.</hi> 22.

               <note place="margin">A Bill about <hi>Painters</hi> and <hi>Plaiſterers.</hi>
               </note> was moved by Sir <hi>George Moore,</hi> and ſome others, that this Bill might be let ſlip, and the Cauſe referred to the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe it concerned a Controverſy between the <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and <hi>Plaiſterers.</hi> To which,</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> Anſwered, <hi>That the laſt Parliament this Bill ſhould have Paſſed this Houſe; but it was referred as now deſired, and Bonds made by the</hi> Plaiſterers <hi>for performance of the Orders made by the</hi> Lord Mayor; <hi>yet all will do no Good, wherefore, Mr.</hi> Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, <hi>I think it good it ſhould be put to the Queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Stephen Somes</hi> ſtood up, and deſired, <hi>That my</hi> Lord-Mayor <hi>might not be troubled with them: but that it might be put to the Queſtion; and it ſeemed likely to go againſt the</hi> Painters.</p>
            <q>
               <p>But I ſtood up, as it was putting to the Queſtion, and

                  </note> and his Knave <hi>Three-Half-Pence</hi> (ſo was his Labourer called;) they continued ſo until King <hi>Hen. 7th's.</hi> time, who brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with him, out of <hi>France,</hi> certain Men that uſed <hi>Plaiſter</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> about the Kings Ceilings and Walls, whoſe Statute-Labourers theſe <hi>Dawbers</hi> were.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Statute-Labourers learned, in ſhort time, the Uſe of <hi>Plaiſter</hi> of <hi>Parts,</hi> and did it for the King, and increaſed to be many; then ſueing to the King for his Favor to Incorporate them, who fulfill'd their deſire, and Incorporated them by the Name of <hi>Gipſarii;</hi> which was for Clay or Mudd, <hi>aliàs</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-makers, <hi>Anno</hi> 16 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. Being no Free-Men, for all their Incorporation, they obtained the Kings Favourable Letters to Sir <hi>William Remington,</hi> then <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> to allow them Free-men. Which was granted.</p>
               <p>At which time came in Four of them, and paid <hi>Ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> a piece for their Freedom, and in Three Years, after that manner, came in the Number of <hi>Twenty;</hi> but they paid <hi>Four Pounds</hi> a piece for Their Freedom.</p>
               <p>They Renewed their Patent in King <hi>Hen. 8's.</hi> time, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves <hi>Plaiſterers,</hi> aliàs, <hi>Morter-makers,</hi> for the Uſe of <hi>Loame</hi> and <hi>Lime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They made an humble Petition, and Supplication after this, to Sir <hi>John Munday</hi> then <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> and the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> to grant them Orders for the better Rule and Government of their Company, in theſe words:</p>
               <p>We the good Folkes of <hi>Plaiſterers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> of <hi>Plaiſter</hi> and <hi>Loame</hi> of the ſaid City, for the Redreſs of certain Abuſes of <hi>Lath-Plaiſter,</hi> and <hi>Loame</hi> wrought in the ſaid Crafts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then had allowed unto them Search for their Company, for the Uſe of <hi>Lath, Loame,</hi> and <hi>Lime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all their Incorporations, at no time, they had any words for Colours; neither yet in their Ordnances. For all they were Incorporated by the name of <hi>Plaiſterers;</hi> yet all King <hi>Hen. 8's.</hi> time, they were called <hi>Dawbers,</hi> as appeareth in the accompts of the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> paid to ſuch and ſuch <hi>Dawbers,</hi> for ſo many Days ſo much, and to their Labourers ſo much.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Plaiſterers,</hi> never laid any Colours in the Kings Houſes, nor in the <hi>Sherifs</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> but this Year; they wore no Livery or Cloathing the <hi>Seventeenth</hi> of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>They have been ſuffered to lay Ale-houſe Colours, as <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead</hi> and <hi>Oaker,</hi> and ſuch like, and ſo now they intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into all Colours.</p>
               <p>Thus they take not only their own Work, but Painting alſo, and leave nothing to do for the Painter.</p>
               <p>Painters, and Stainers, were two ſeveral Companies in King <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. time. One for Poſts, and all Timber-work to Paint. And the other, for Painting and Staining of Cloth; of great
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:107812:151"/>continuance; both Companies were joyned into one, by their own Conſent, and by the Conſent of the Lord Mayor, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen of the City.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nineteenth</hi> Year of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. The Painters had Orders al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them for the Uſe of Oyl, and Colours eſpecially named, in <hi>Hen. 4's.</hi> time, from the Lord Mayor and City. Painters can not work without Colours, their only mixture being Oyl and Size, which the Plaiſterers do now Uſurp and Intrude into.</p>
               <p>Painters have her Majeſty's Letters Patents Dated <hi>Anno</hi> 24. <hi>Reginae,</hi> forbidding any Artificer the Uſe of Colours and Oyl or Size after the manner of Painting, but ſuch as hath been or ſhall be an Apprentice with a Painter, Seven Years at the leaſt.</p>
               <p>And where the Plaiſterers do Object, That the Painters do Abridge other Companies of their Colours; That is moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently untrue: For Gold-ſmiths uſe Colours, but not after the manner of Painting, and work without Oyl, or Size, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amelling. Leather-ſellers Colour their Leather, but not after the manner of Painting, but work without Oyl or Size. Book-binders uſe Colours, but neither with Oyl or Size, So Cutlers uſe Varniſhing, and Gilding. So Glaſiers uſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, with nealing in the Oven. Brick-layers uſe Colours, but neither with Oyl nor Size, and Joyners likewiſe do uſe Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
               <p>Workmanſhip and Skill is the Gift of God; and not one in ten proveth a Workman, yet it is requiſite, that all ſuch as have been brought up all the days of their life in a Trade, and cannot attain to that Excellency of Skill that is required, ſhould live by the baſer part of their Science, when they can not attain to the better; which is in working in Oyl and Size, thoſe flat Poſts, and Windows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Plaiſterers be ſuffer'd to Paint, Workmanſhip in Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting will decay; for no Workman will keep an Apprentice <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> Years to Practice, and not able to get a Penny, unleſs he might now and then get ſomewhat towards his Meat and Drink in laying of Oyl-Colours, as on Poſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Experience teacheth us now, That amongſt the Number of <hi>There Hundred</hi> there are not now <hi>Twelve</hi> ſufficient Workmen in the City of <hi>London;</hi> yet one of theſe (<hi>Francis De Miter</hi> ſuch was his Poverty) was fain for his Releif to Wife and Children, to wear upon the <hi>Lord Mayors Day,</hi> a Blew Gown, and a Red Cap, and to carry a Torch, he being <hi>Fifty</hi> Years Old.</p>
               <p>One man will lay and Paint more Colours in a day, than ten men can grind, which grinding of Colours, ſhould be the Relief of ſuch as cannot Attain to Workmanſhip, and that is taken away by the Plaiſterers, and the poor men the Painters, their Wives and Children, go a Begging for want of Work.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Painting of Cloth is decayed, and not <hi>One Hundred</hi> Yards of new Painted Cloth made here in a Year, by reaſon of ſo much painted <hi>Flanders</hi> pieces brought from thence. So that the Painters have nothing to live on, but laying of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:107812:152"/>Oyl-Colours on Poſts, Windows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a curious Art, and requireth a good Eye, and a ſtedfaſt Hand, which the infirmity of Age decayeth quickly, and then Painters go a begging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plaiſterers</hi> take mony generally from the higheſt Perſonage, to the loweſt or meaneſt Cottage, whoſe Walls muſt needs be made. Painters take money but of a few, for their delight. Painters give to the Plaiſterers ſix kind of Colours, commonly uſed; (as the Bill importeth) to be laid with Size, and not with Oyl. And for every <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> earned with Oyl-Colours, there is <hi>Ten Pound</hi> earned with Size-Colours, they being every mans money.</p>
               <p>Theſe Walls,<note place="margin">The Bill paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> thus Curiouſly Painted in former Ages, the Arms ſo Artificially Drawn, the Imagery ſo perfectly done, do Witneſs our Fore-fathers Care in Cheriſhing this Art of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. So, I think the Bill is very reaſonable, and fit to paſs, And ſo it did.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. Attorney General, and Doctor <hi>Cary</hi> came from the Lords, &amp; ſhewed, Their Lordſhips were ready for a Conference, touching the Bill concerning Patents, and that they had given power to their Committees, fully and finally to determine the ſame; and deſired, that our Committees might come with the like Power, which was granted; but a great Number cried, <hi>No, No.</hi>

            <p>It was put to the Queſtion for the paſſage, and the Houſe was divided, And the <hi>I, I, I,</hi> were <hi>Ninety Five,</hi> and the <hi>Noes Forty One.</hi> So the Bill paſſed.</p>
            <p>There was a Queſtion in the Houſe, upon the Bill for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Souldiers, Whether the Old Levy of <hi>Two Pence</hi> a Pariſh ſhould ſtand, or <hi>Six Pence</hi> a Pariſh?</p>
            <p>To which,<note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> moves for the poor Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">The Law for the Relief of Souldiers, I take to be both juſt and Honourable, and that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery which proceeds from Obedience, Worthy to be Pitied and Relieved; for their Obedience hath ſhewed it ſelf, even by Sacrificing their Bloods for our Goods; and there is liker to be a continuance, than a decay of their Miſeries. I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay it, there is never a Souldier Relieved with ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, as his Miſery requireth, and his Service hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And therefore I think <hi>Six Pence</hi> a Pariſh, at the leaſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So they went to the Conference, and the Houſe ſent up theſe Bills, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Bill againſt Fairs and Markets on Sundays.</item>

               <item>7. The Bill for making a Harbour or Key on the North ſide of <hi>Devon.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>8. The Bill for Aſſurance of certain Lands to <hi>Sandes</hi> and <hi>Harris.</hi> And, Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> was intreated to deliver them unto the Lords.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Bill for the Redreſs of Abuſes and miſ-employment of Goods and Lands given to Charitable Uſes, was Read the firſt time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Solicitor General <hi>Fleming</hi> Moved, <q rend="inline">That although the Order of the Houſe was, A Bill ſhould not be Read twice in one morning; yet in reſpect that this was a Bill of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, he Prayed, That it would pleaſe the Houſe it might be Read again. And it accordingly was. And ſo it was by Order preſently Committed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Snigg</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">I would humbly pray the Houſe, that the Bill of Clothing which hath at length taken, and laid open the Theft of <hi>England,</hi> which we have ſo long followed with Hue and Cry, I mean the <hi>Tayntor,</hi> may be <hi>Read.</hi> It Robs God of his Honour, and us of our Clothing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">And I humbly preſent unto this Houſe, the natural Born Child of us all, I mean the Bill againſt Tranſportation of Ordnance, which is Amended, and a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo added, with Licence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I humbly pray the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments may be Read; And the Bill put to the Queſtion.</q> And ſo they were, after a little Diſpute, and Ordered to be Ingroſſed.</p>
            <p>The Bill for Maimed Souldiers, was Read, To which Mr. <hi>Roger Owen</hi> ſpake, ſhewing that he was commanded by all the Juſtices of the Peace for <hi>Salop,</hi> to Deliver unto the Houſe the poor Eſtate of the County, and therefore prayed, a Proviſo might be added to exempt that County.</p>
            <p>But it was replied to him, That he went about to Deck up his particular <hi>Cabbin,</hi> when the Ship was on Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Afternoon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Bill for the Eſtabliſhing of the Remainder of certain Lands of <hi>Andrew Ketleby</hi> Eſq; to <hi>Francis Ketleby,</hi> was Committed, and the place and time of Meeting was the <hi>Court of Wards,</hi> On <hi>Monday</hi> Morning by Eight of the Clock, and the Councel on both ſides to be there.</p>
            <p>A Bill for the more diligent Repair to the Church on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,</hi> was Read;<note place="margin">A Bill for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Church,</hi> &amp;c.</note> To which</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bond</hi> ſaid: This Bill as it is now Ingroſſed, much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from the Firſt, which was here preſented, which I the better like of; notwithſtanding, in my Opinion the Bill is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together needleſs, and divers Reaſons move me to think it both inconvenient, and unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>Every Evil in a State, is not to be met with in a Law. And as it is in the natural, ſo it is in the politique Body, that ſometimes the Remedy is worſe than the Diſeaſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:107812:153"/>particular Laws againſt particular Offences, produce No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, and in Novelty Contempt. <hi>Hippedmans Miletius,</hi> offered to Reward any Man Bountifully, which could invent a Good and New Law. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> condemneth that Policy. And the beſt Orator, <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> condemneth that State which will admit of any Innovation; although it be good in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>If this Bill paſs, there will two imputations happen to the State, which Wiſedom wills us both to Foreſee and Shunn. The Firſt, an Infamy to our Miniſters, that our Adverſaries may ſay, This is the Fruit of your Labour, to have Preached away your Audience out of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Second, No leſs, but a greater Imputation upon our <hi>Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Arch-Dearons,</hi> and other <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; that they be either remiſs in their Authority, or elſe that their Prerogative hath not ſo much Power as a <hi>Twelve-Pence</hi> Fine. And doubtleſs theſe Imputations cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, if we give the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſuch Head, Scope, and Comfort, as they in their Writings do greedily Apprehend.</p>
               <p>I do conceive, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> great difference between the Law, 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> when time was, and this Law, 44. <hi>Eliz.</hi> as now it is: then the People were newly taken from Maſſing &amp; Superſtition; now are planted in Truth, and rooted in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; the Light did then ſcarce appear unto them, which now ſhineth with Glorious Beams upon our Teachers, and Eccleſiaſtical Judges. And as the Malice of the Adverſary was only kindled againſt them in the Beginning; ſo is it ſtretched forth to put down, and Flameth like a conſuming Fire to devour our Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſons aforeſaid, were the Ground-Work of <hi>Oſorius</hi>'s Foundation in his Epiſtle unto Her Majeſty, to give Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſpake Evil. I will give but a Reaſon or two more, and ſo end.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe, that a neglector of Church-Service, comes to the Seſſions, there to be Examined, alleadging an Excuſe, many buſineſſes ſo concern the door not to be known, that to ſpeak Truth would be his undoing. And not to ſpeak Truth, would be a Wound unto his Conſcience: and to ſay his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were a meer Mockery; and to ſay an untruth, an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Danger.</p>
               <p>If this Law may ſtand for a Law, me thinks, I ſee what Breach of Charity will happen. Say there be <hi>Forty</hi> in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh abſent, the <hi>Church-Warden</hi> preſents ſome, and not others; it will be Objected unto him. Wherefore ſhould I be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and not he? my Wife, my Servant, my Friend, and not his? Will not this be a great Breach of Unity and Peace?</p>
               <p>Juſt Proſecution will be infinitely Cumberſome, and partial connivance ſubject to Quarrel; notwithſtanding this Statute, we leave Power to the Eccleſiaſtical Judge; whoſe courſe is to proceed to Excommunication, and ſo an <hi>Excommunicato ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendo</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:107812:153"/>muſt be had; this is as great a Charge as the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> In this Statute, a Witneſs or two muſt be brought to the Seſſions. He muſt be preſented to the <hi>Grand-Jury,</hi> and ſo Indicted. This will coſt <hi>Five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> a <hi>Noble,</hi> or <hi>Ten Shillings,</hi> which is as much as the Charge in the firſt Statute. So becauſe this Bill is Scandalous to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> Scandalous to the <hi>State,</hi> and Repugnant to Charity, and <hi>Crambe recocta;</hi> I pray it may receive the like entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the former Bill had, <hi>viz.</hi> to be Rejected.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Haſtings</hi> ſaid: I ſhall ſpeak upon great Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Fran. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings</hi> Anſwers him.</note> I perceive this Member of our Houſe, hath taken Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Pains to diſturb the paſſage of this Bill; to which I ſhall not ſo well Anſwer, becauſe I cannot ſo well carry away the particulars of this Politique, but not Religious Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>If it be Religion to be Obedient at pleaſure, If I could be Zealous to Day, and Cold to Morrow: I could Subſcribe to all that he hath ſaid. We cannot do a more acceptable thing to God, nor a more Dutiful Service to the <hi>State,</hi> than to bring Men to Fear God.</p>
               <p>Religion and Policy may well ſtand together; but as that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy is moſt Deteſtable, which hath not Religion to warrant it: So is that Religion moſt happy, that hath Policy to back and maintain it. I know the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> be out of ſquare, and be at Jar amongſt themſelves; I pray God it be not to make a Breach amongſt us, who be yet at Unity.</p>
               <p>Wit well Applied, is a profitable thing, but ill Applied, Dangerous in whoſoever doth abuſe it. There is no Man of Senſe and Religion, but thinks he is far from Religion (poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Mr. <hi>Bond</hi>) that made the Speech firſt. He ſaid, <hi>It would be an Imputation to our Miniſters,</hi> That Speech was both abſurd in Judgment, and Scandalous in Uttering; as though by the Miniſters of the Word, we loath to hear of our Sins, or reconcile our ſelves unto God.</p>
               <p>The Second, That it was an Imputation to <hi>Arch-Biſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> &amp;c. I am ſo far from blaming their Government, that I Renounce that poſition, and am very ſorry, that the ſtrength of their Authority, ſtretcheth not ſo far as I could wiſh it did in this Point.</p>
               <p>But methinks this Law ſhould rather be a Credit to the Miniſters, That now we having gone to Church theſe <hi>Forty Three</hi> Years our ſelves, and are ſo fervent in Religion; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire alſo, that others may do the like.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, give me leave to wipe away a Grievance, which it ſeems, the Gentleman that laſt ſpake, imputeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; he hath made a proteſtation that be is no <hi>Papiſt,</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you all, if I ſaid he was. And I ſay, he is no <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> if he be not a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> for if there be ever a <hi>Puritan</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> it is a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> I Learned of Doctor <hi>Humfries,</hi> who was ſometimes my Tutor, a Diviſion of Four Sorts of <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who hold a Man cannot Sin after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:107812:154"/>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who is ſuch a <hi>Merit-Monger,</hi> that he would not only ſave himſelf by his own <hi>Merits,</hi> but by the <hi>Merits</hi> of others alſo.</p>
               <p>A <hi>3d.</hi> Sort, are the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> or <hi>Family of Love.</hi> A <hi>Sect</hi> too well known in <hi>England:</hi> I would they never had ſo been.</p>
               <p>The <hi>4th.</hi> and laſt Sort, are, your <hi>Evangelical Puritans,</hi> which rely wholly upon the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as upon a ſure Ground. And of theſe, I would we had many more than we now have.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Glaſcocke,</hi> Mr. <hi>Spicer,</hi> and divers others, made ſeveral Speeches; but becauſe it grew Dark, I could not Write them.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Cary</hi> came from the Lords, and brought a Bill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Captains, Souldiers, and Mariners, and other the Queens Servants in the <hi>Realm.</hi> Alſo another Bill for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Navy, Increaſe of Mariners, and the Avoiding the ſcarcity of Victuals.</p>
            <p>It was ſhewed by Doctor <hi>Bennet,</hi> upon occaſion of Speech of the Multitude of Recuſants, that there were <hi>Thirteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> nay, <hi>Fifteen Hundred</hi> Recuſants in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> which he vouched upon his Credit were preſented in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical-Court,</hi> and before the Councel at <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, after divers other Speeches and Arguments, it was put to the Queſtion, Whether the Bill ſhould be Ingroſſed? The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof was, That if any Man came Eight times in the Year to the Church, and read the Divine Service Twice every <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Holyday</hi> in his Houſe, with his whole Family, that ſhould be a ſufficient Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>This was utterly miſliked, yet divers that were minded to overthrow the Bill, went forth with the Proviſo, becauſe they would have it joyned with the Bill to overthrow it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Houſe was divided, and upon diviſion it appeared thus, the <hi>I, I, I,</hi> were <hi>One Hundred Twenty Six,</hi> and the <hi>No, Noes Eighty Five.</hi> So the Proviſo paſſed.</p>
            <p>Then it was put to the Queſtion for Paſſing of the Bill, but then divers Reaſons were ſhewed to the contrary. Mr. <hi>Bonds,</hi> two Reaſons of prejudice to Miniſters, and the Clergy, and the danger by Breach of Charity, That the Information was a thing contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> That there might be a Conviction without inquiry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> ſhewed,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Walt. Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> againſt the Bill.</note> 
            </p>
            <p>That all the <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> of every <hi>Shire,</hi> muſt come to the Seſſions to give Information to the <hi>Grand-Jury.</hi> Say then there be 100 and 20 Pariſhes in a <hi>Shire;</hi> there muſt now come Extraordinarily 200 &amp; 40 <hi>Church-Wardens;</hi> and ſay, that but Two in a Pariſh Offend in a Quarter of a Year, that makes <hi>Four Hundred</hi> and <hi>Eighty</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens (with the Offenders) to appear. What great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes this will bring together! What Quarrelling and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may happen, beſides giving Authority to a mean <hi>Church-Warden!</hi> How prejudicial this may be! with divers other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt it As alſo, he ſaid, There was ſome Ambig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities and Equivocations therein, the Proviſo being newly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:107812:154"/>being a plain Toleration from coming to Church. And that the Parſon could not preſent or conſtrain any, if they read Service at Home.</p>
            <p>So it was put to the Queſtion, thrice together; and becauſe the Truth could not be diſcerned, the Houſe was again divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And the <hi>I, I, I,</hi> went forth and were 105. and the <hi>Noes</hi> within were 106. ſo it was loſt by one Voice. But the <hi>I, I, I,</hi> ſaid, they had Mr. Speakers Voice, which would make it even. And then it grew a Queſtion, whether Mr. Speaker had a Voice?</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Hobby,</hi> who was of the <hi>I, I, I,</hi> ſide, ſaid,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Query,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> have a Vote?</note> 
               <hi>That when Her Majeſty had given us leave to Chooſe our Speaker, ſhe gave us leave to chooſe one out of our own Number, and not a ſtranger. He is a Citizen of</hi> London, <hi>and a Member, and therefore he hath a Voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which it was Anſwered, by Sir</hi> Walter Rawleigh,<note place="margin">The <hi>Speaker</hi> declares he hath not, by Cuſtom, any Vote.</note> 
               <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Speaker himſelf, That he was fore-cloſed of his Voice, by taking of that Place which it had pleaſed them to impoſe upon him, and that he was to be indifferent for both Parties.</hi> And withal ſhewed, That by the Old Order of the Houſe, The Bil was loſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Boyer,</hi> Secretary to the Lord <hi>Buckhurſt,</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">A Complaint of Foul Play, &amp;c.</note> Mr. <hi>Speaker, I think it not loſt, for there hath been foul and great Abuſe Offer'd in this matter. A Gentleman that would willingly have gone forth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Conſcience, was pulled back. Though I much Reverence my Maſters of the</hi> Temple, <hi>and am much bound to the</hi> Benchers <hi>of the</hi> Midle-Temple, <hi>yet if it will pleaſe the Houſe, and you,</hi> Mr. <hi>Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, to Command me to Name him, I will.</hi> The greateſt Voice ſaid <hi>No;</hi> yet Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> willed him to Name him. And he ſaid, Mr. <hi>Dale</hi> of the <hi>Midle-Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> ſaid: <hi>Why? if it pleaſe you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Walt. Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> Accuſes himſelf of a Weakneſs.</note> 
               <hi>it is a ſmall matter to pull one by the Sleeve, for ſo have I done my ſelf often times.</hi> And a great Stir was in the Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Comptroller, after ſome ſilence, ſaid:<note place="margin">The <hi>Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller</hi> takes him up for it.</note> 
               <hi>We have been often troubled by Phyſitians,</hi> (meaning Mr. <hi>Bond,</hi>) <hi>and they have been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt: He troubled us with</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>&amp; other Books. If he had ſtaid there, it had been well. But I think, we had need of Phyſitians to ſtay our Heads, and Cool our Heats and Humours, not fitting a Court of Parliament; For it is a moſt intolerable Diſorder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do think the Offence an heynous Offence, both againſt God and this Aſſembly; for the</hi> Firſt, <hi>in that every man is to go according to his Conſcience, and not by Compulſion. And for the other Gentleman,</hi> (<hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sir</hi> Walter Rawleigh) <hi>that ſaid, he had often done the like, I think he may be aſhamed of it; for large is his Conſcience, that in a matter of this Conſequence, will be drawn either forward or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the Sleeve. And I think it fit, it is ſo Heynous, that he anſwer it at the Bar</hi> (<hi>meaning Mr.</hi> Dale.) <hi>But becauſe Sir</hi> Walter Rawleigh <hi>was laſt named, it was taken to be meant of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid: I am ſorry to ſee this diſorder,<note place="margin">Is Seconded by <hi>Cecil.</hi>
                  </note> and little do you know how for diſorder the Parliament is Taxed. I am ſorry I ſaid not, Slandered. I hoped as this Parliament began gravely, and with judgment, ſo we ſhould have ended
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:107812:155"/>modeſtly, and at leaſt with diſcretion. I proteſt I have a Libel in my Pocket againſt the Proceedings of this Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Offence, that the Gentleman that laſt ſpake, ſpake of, I confeſs is great and puniſhable. And this I wiſh may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him, that he whoſe Voice may be drawn either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or backward by the ſleeves, like a Dog in a ſtring, may no more be of this Houſe; and I wiſh for his Credit ſake, he would not. But, that it ſhould be ſo great as to be called to the Bar, I ſee no Reaſon; neither do I know, why any in this Houſe ſhould ſpeak ſo Imperiouſly, as to have a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Place and Quality (pointing to Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>) called to the Bar.</p>
               <p>For the matter it ſelf, the <hi>Noes</hi> were 106. and the <hi>I, I, I,</hi> 105. Mr. Speaker hath no Voice; and though I am ſorry to ſay it, yet I muſt needs confeſs loſt it is, and farewel it.And ſo the Houſe roſe confuſedly, it being after ſix a Clock.</p>
            </q>
            <p>There was another Gentleman (a <hi>Noe</hi>) pulled out, as well as the other was kept in, and therefore it had happen'd even as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; howſoever, Mr. <hi>Edward Johns</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barker</hi> pulled Mr. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Ducket</hi> out.</p>

            <p>A Bill againſt Bankrupts, lewd Apprentices, and evil Factors.</p>
            <p>The Houſe was divided upon the ſecond Reading of the Bill, the <hi>I, I, I,</hi> were 35. and the <hi>Noes</hi> 45. ſo the Bill was not to be Read the third time, being loſt by ten Voices.</p>
            <p>A Bill for the Cloth-workers of <hi>London,</hi> Ordered to be Ingroſſed.</p>
            <p>A Bill for the Recovery of many Hundred Thouſand Acres of drowned Grounds in the Ile of <hi>Ely,</hi> and in the Counties of <hi>Cambridg, Huntington, Northampton, Lincoln, Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> &amp;c. was Ordered to be Committed.</p>
            <p>A Bill for the Denization of certain Perſons, <hi>viz. Joſepho Lupo,</hi> and one <hi>Queſtor,</hi> and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fettyplace</hi> ſhewed: <q rend="inline">That <hi>Queſtor,</hi> as he was Informed, had neither Father nor Mother <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and therefore not fit to be Endenizen'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">This <hi>Queſtor</hi> is a Factor for Merchants, Strangers, and an Ingroſſer of Fiſh, and keeps a Ware-houſe here in <hi>London.</hi> And now, becauſe he would Defraud the Queen of a double Subſidy, being an Alien Stranger, he would be Indenizen'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">I know <hi>Queſtor</hi> well, he hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Queen long, and done Her good ſervice, he hath been theſe 36. Years in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; hath ever ſhewed himſelf a good Subject; and for his good Service, I ſee no Reaſon but he ſhould be permitted to paſs with the reſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">I know this man <hi>Queſtor</hi> well; this Teſtimony I am able to give of him, that he is a man of good Subſtance, and of Qualitie, and of his quality I know not an honeſter man in <hi>England;</hi> he hath done good Service both to the Queen, and to the State; and that to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:107812:155"/>For the matter of Cuſtom, I know her Majeſty is well pleaſed therewith, and therefore no Defrauding. That he ſhould be an Ingroſſer of Fiſh for Strangers, it may be; but I think he is not. I proteſt if I knew he were, I ſhould hate him as I do hate Monopolies. It is no great matter if we put him in, for the Bill may be quaſhed either in the Upper-Houſe, or Her Majeſty may daſh him out, at her Pleaſure. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, that was appointed this Forenoon in <hi>Ketlebies</hi> Caſe in the <hi>Court of Wards,</hi> is appointed to be this afternoon in the ſame place. Becauſe the Council who were Committees, and the Cauſe being of great Weight, <hi>Five Hundred Pounds Per Annum,</hi> were to go preſently to end the Conference with the Lords, touching Patents, for they tarried for them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Francis Moore</hi> brought in the Bill for continuance of ſome Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and Repeal of ſome others, with two Proviſoes touching <hi>Dover-Haven,</hi> (and the longer was accepted) I leave it, quoth he, to the Conſideration of the Houſe, to take whether they liſt, or to refuſe both; and here ſtayed whilſt the Clerk of the Crown and a Doctor brought two Bills from the Lords, which had paſt this Houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Exchequer-Bill without any amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only a ſhort Proviſo added to the end, the Effect whereof was:</p>
            <p>That upon Order in the open Court, it ſhould be Lawful for any Officer, Clerk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to award <hi>Proceſs,</hi> and drive the Parties to Plead <hi>Quo titulo,</hi> &amp;c. which was Prohibited by the Bill. The ſecond was the Bill touching the joynture of <hi>Lucy</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Bedford,</hi> with ſome amendments, and a Proviſo.</p>
            <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">If ever there was a time to look to the <hi>Ports</hi> and <hi>Havens,</hi> it is now. If you remember,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cecil</hi> about <hi>Dover</hi>-Haven.</note> what place is <hi>Ex oppoſito</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> what Neighbours we have, and how greatly that <hi>Haven</hi> doth ſtand us in ſtead, I believe you would be more willing to add, than to take any thing away from the maintenance thereof. I wiſh therefore, to end this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, that this may be the Queſtion, Whether of theſe two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſoes ſhall be added to the Law? But I think the greateſt is beſt, and largeſt, and I ſhould be loth to Detract any thing from that Contribution: So the greater was taken.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Amendments in the Bill of Aſſurance, uſed amongſt Merchants.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hackwell</hi> ſaid: I think, <hi>Mr.</hi> Speaker, we do not give that Favor to a Bill which lies dormant in this Houſe, as the Bill meriteth. It was well ſaid, by one, that Ships were the Walls of our Kingdom; which if we ſuffer to Decay, as I am certainly aſſured they are Decaying, not only a quarter, or third part, but even half, and as our ſtrength Diminiſheth, ſo our Enemies increaſe.</p>
               <p>And therfore <hi>Mr.</hi> Speaker, it being for a publique Good, and general Happineſs to us all, I wiſh ſo profitable a Bill may be <hi>Read,</hi> and have good paſſage; it is Intituled, A Bill touching Souldiers, Mariners, and maintenance of Shipping.</p>
            </q>
            <p>A Bill for the Repealing of an Act made 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> concerning lengths of <hi>Kerſies,</hi> was Committed.</p>

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:107812:156"/>St. <hi>Bartholomews, Bridewell,</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas the</hi> Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>The Act for Confirmation of Statutes put to the Queſtion, and agreed to be Ingroſſed.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edw. Hobby</hi> moved the Houſe, to have their Opinions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Proviſo ſent down from the Lords, with the Exchequer-Bill, which was Ingroſſed in Parchment; for he ſomewhat doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of it, and thought it ought to be in Paper; for all Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that come from the Lords uſe to be in Paper, and not in Parchment, but agreed, That it was well, and according to the courſe of the Houſe to be in Parchment.</p>
            <p>The Bill for the Repairing and Amending two Bridges, near <hi>Carliſle</hi> over the River of <hi>Eden,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> being Ingroſſed, it was Read and Paſſed, and ſent up to the Lords by Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> and others. And the Copy of the Information againſt Mr. <hi>Bellgrave,</hi> under the Hand of the Clerk of the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill concerning the Aſſize for Feuel, Ordered to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed and Paſſed.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> moved, and ſhewed, That a Servant of Mr. <hi>Hudleſtons</hi> (Knight for <hi>Cumberland</hi>) I think, being ſome twelve months ſince, hurt in the Hand, went unto one <hi>Mathews</hi> a Surgeon by <hi>Fleet-Bridg,</hi> who for <hi>Ten Pound</hi> undertook the Cure; the Man gave him a Bill of <hi>Ten Pound</hi> for the ſaid Cure, which, he the ſaid <hi>Mathews</hi> could not perform, without leaving a great Scar, and withal a little lameneſs in his hand, notwithſtanding he paid the Surgeon <hi>Eight Found:</hi> but upon what ſuggeſtion I know not, <hi>Mathews</hi> hath ſued Mr <hi>Hudleſtons</hi> man for the whole <hi>Ten Pound,</hi> and Arreſted him upon an Execution, into the Counter. The man told him, he was Mr. <hi>Hudleſtons</hi> man, and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was a Member of this Houſe, and a Knight of a Shire, and that he was thereby privileged from Arreſt, and wiſhed to be diſcharged. But <hi>Mathews,</hi> and the Serjeant ſaid, they cared not for his Maſter, nor his Privilege; and ſaid, that he was not priviledged from an Execution. And ſo being carried to the Counter, he told the like to the Clerks, who affirmed likewiſe, that Priviledges would not ſtretch to Executions, and therefore would not diſcharge him.</p>
               <p>And therefore I Pray, that both the Clerks, <hi>Mathews,</hi> and the Serjeant, may be ſent for. And ſo it was Ordered, they ſhould Appear to morrow in the Forenoon.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Bill againſt ordinary and uſual Swearing, was ordered to be Ingroſſed, and ſo Paſſed.</p>
            <p>The Bill that Concerns Captains, Souldiers, and Mariners, which came from the Lords, was Read the firſt time.</p>
            <p>The Bill for Relief of the Poor, was brought in with Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and agreed to be Ingroſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Afternoon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill touching the Weaving of Silk and Gold Laces, after a little Debate, by the greater part, it was Rejected. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt the Bill were: 1. That it was Incroaching a Liberty to have two miles compaſs. 2. That it was too General; ſilk Wares,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:107812:156"/>and all other Stuffs. 3. That it was a Prohibition of making or ſelling of <hi>Norwich</hi> Stuffs. 4. That the ſearch in the Bill, was too General, and the Forfeiture too great. 5. That it was a diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to have all Silk Stuffs. For Statute-Lace with a third of Silk, will ſhew and ſell better; ſo of Stuffs for Childrens Coats. That the Search was General as well within Liberties, as without.</p>
            <p>I offered to ſpeak before the Queſtion was half asked, but could not be ſuffered, the <hi>Noes</hi> were ſo great. And it being put to the Queſtion, over-ruled, and the Bill Rejected.</p>
            <p>A Bill,<note place="margin">A Bill about the City, &amp;c.</note> that the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould have full Power and Government over, and in the Liberties of St. <hi>Katherines, Read.</hi> To which Bill,</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſpake, and ſaid:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> Argues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</note> 
               <q rend="inline">That diverſe particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, had Purchaſed Lands within the Liberty; and had given much more for the ſame, in reſpect of the Priviledge, than otherwiſe they would have done. And now this Bill wipeth away all their Right. And Mr. Speaker, I hope I may ſpeak it without Offence, This Parliament hath been more troubled with Bills for Incroaching Liberties about the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> than any three Parliaments before.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Sir <hi>Steven Some</hi> ſaid: I am bound to defend <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Stev. Some</hi> for the City.</note> and I cannot, under your Favor, ſuffer the Imputation laid againſt us: For, Mr. Speaker, I ſay to you, theſe Priviledges are the very ſink of Sin, the Nurcery of naughty and lewd People, the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Rogues, Theeves, and Beggars, and maintainers of idle Perſons; for when our Shops and Houſes be Robbed, thither they fly for Relief and Sanctuary, and we cannot help our ſelves.</p>
               <p>The City ſeeing this, Purchaſed it of the Lord <hi>Thomas Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> ſuppoſing to have had all the ſaid Priviledges; but finding the contrary by Experience, they now are inforced to ſue for your Favours, to have it paſs by Act of Parliament. This is the Cauſe, and I leave it to your Conſiderations: whereupon it was put to the Queſtion, and the Houſe was Divided, and the <hi>I, I, I,</hi> were 94. and the <hi>Noes</hi> 86.</p>

            <p>On <hi>Tueſday Decemb.</hi> 15.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Snigg</hi> moved, to have the Bill for Clothing <hi>Read,</hi> which was <hi>Read,</hi> accordingly.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Phettiplace,</hi> prayed the Houſe to have conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Merchants were fit to have Conſideration for Cockling and Squales, and ſo to make abatement to the Clothier. And he thought not, becauſe in outward ſhew, it ſeemed good; yet there lurks a hurt to the Merchant. And ſo it was put to the Queſtion, and Ordered to be Ingroſſed.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Anthony Mathews</hi> a Surgeon, who dwelt about <hi>Fleet-Bridg,</hi> cauſed a Serjeant to Arreſt one <hi>Curwyn,</hi> Servant to Mr. <hi>Hudleſton</hi>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:107812:157"/>Knight, for <hi>Cumberland.</hi> It appeared, that <hi>Curwin</hi> was a Solicitor, and a Servant to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Hudleſton</hi> for three Years ſpace; and had ſolicited his great Cauſe in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> betwixt <hi>Delebar</hi> and himſelf; the Truth of the Caſe was this: <hi>Curwin</hi> falling into talk with another, about <hi>Fleet-Bridg,</hi> touching Mr. <hi>Hudleſtons</hi> Cauſe; they fell out there, and Fought, and <hi>Curwin</hi> was Hurt ſore in the Hand; ſo he went to this <hi>Mathews,</hi> being the next Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who dreſſed him; and after, it was agreed, that <hi>Mathews</hi> ſhould have for the Cure <hi>Ten Pounds,</hi> viz. <hi>Four Pounds</hi> in hand, and Mr. <hi>Hudleſtons</hi> and his Bill for the Payment of the other <hi>Six Pounds</hi> when the Cure was done. Which Bill was Read openly. Now, it was Averr'd and Confeſſed, the Cure was done, and that <hi>Four Pounds</hi> more was Paid, and <hi>Mathews</hi> contented to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the other <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> untill the next Term following; but it was not paid. Whereupon the ſaid <hi>Mathews</hi> (it being three Years ſince due) cauſed <hi>Curwin</hi> to be Arreſted. And Mr. <hi>Hudleſton</hi> ſhewed this to the Houſe, and Offer'd (ſo he might have his man free) to pay the money due. And becauſe it was Averr'd, that the Serjeant knew not of the ſaid <hi>Curwins</hi> being Mr. <hi>Hudleſtons</hi> man, but only was told that he was one of <hi>New-Ian;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was true, and he lay there in his Brothers Chamber, yet ſerved Mr. <hi>Hudleſton;</hi> and the Serjeant offered to Swear the ſame. But the Serjeant ſaid, <hi>That after he was Arreſted,</hi> Curwin <hi>told him he was Mr.</hi> Hudleſtons <hi>Man.</hi> And <hi>Mathews</hi> ſaid, <hi>If you let him go, I will be Anſwer'd by you; look you to it.</hi> Whereupon the Serjeant confeſſed he kept him; and if he had Offended, he ſubmitted himſelf.</p>
            <p>So the Houſe Awarded, the Serjeant ſhould be Diſcharged, paying his Fees; and that <hi>Mathews</hi> ſhould pay them: And <hi>Mathews,</hi> to pay his Fees, and remain Three Days in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants Cuſtody, for procuring the Arreſt: And that <hi>Curwin</hi> ſhould have his Writ of Privilege; And ſo he had.</p>
            <p>This Matter was argued diverſly, Whether he ſhould be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged or no: And ſome thought not; but at length I ſtood up, and ſhewed the Houſe, <hi>That he ought to be privileged; for we had given Judgment in the like Caſe, of the</hi> Baron <hi>of</hi> Waltons <hi>Solicitor this Parliament.</hi> And thereupon it was put to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; And Ordered he ſhould be Privileged.</p>
            <p>The Houſe called to have the Bill of Ordnance Read, and ſent up.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> ſaid: I ſhall move you in a Matter, which though is ſeems diſtaſteful in the beginning; yet I doubt not, but it will be very pleaſing in the ending. I am given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and I know it to be true, for I ſaw it, That the Lords have a Bill in their Houſe, Touching Tranſportation of Ordnance; far more larger in Matter, and more ſtricter in Puniſhment, than ours is. And, where we ſtand ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Words (without Licenſe) and ſpend time therein, they make no ſuch ſcruple, but puts it abſolute.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I dare preſume to Inform you, that the Gentleman that had the Patent, hath made a voluntary and willing Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:107812:157"/>thereof; laying the ſame even at Her Majeſties Feet, which Her Majeſty moſt Gratiouſly and Willingly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>Now my Motion is this, I know their Bill is coming, and that the Parliament will be ſhort: If we ſhall read Ours, and they ſend Theirs; this will breed Diſputation, perhaps Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; and ſo, in ſo good and neceſſary a Cauſe, juſt nothing done, but both neglected. Therefore my deſire is, we may tarry for Theirs. But the Houſe would have it Read, <hi>viz. A Bill againſt Tranſportation of Money, Coin, Plate, Ordnance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday Decemb.</hi> 16. A Bill for the Change of the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names of thoſe that ſhall Marry the two Daughters and Heirs of <hi>William Waller</hi> Eſq into the Name of <hi>Debden,</hi> was read the firſt time.</p>

And their Award to ſtand Good.</p>
            <p>A Bill for the neceſſary Relief of Souldiers, and Marriners, was read, and Ordered to be paſſed.</p>
            <p>A Bill for the true making of <hi>Woollen-Cloth,</hi> was read, and Ordered to be paſſed with a Proviſo.</p>

            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glaſcock</hi> ſaid; Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Glaſcock</hi> ſpeaks to it; and againſt Juſtices of the Peace.</note> I have ſomething Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Bill to deliver to the Houſe, in diſcharge of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And I do humbly and heartily pray you all, to hear me patiently and quietly, without Interruption.</p>
               <p>I have been obſerved Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> to be an Enemy to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace, and to have ſpoken Irreverently, and much againſt them: For my own part, I mind now to make my laſt Speech for this Parliament, and this Proteſtation withal: That I never uſed any Irreverent Language towards thoſe, whoſe Honeſty joyned with their Authority, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:107812:158"/>Famous, under the Title of Upright Juſtices. My Speech, was never uttered againſt them, but againſt two ſorts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, that have Authority at the Commiſſion of Muſters; (for a I within the County, are Authorized Generally by the word <hi>Juſtices</hi>) by whom I would be loath to be Yoaked, or Commanded. The firſt is, the Uncircumciſed Juſtice of Peace; the other, The Adultering Juſtice of Peace.</p>
               <p>The Uncircumciſed Juſtice,<note place="margin">Two ſorts of Justices of the Peace: called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed, Adultering</hi> Juſtices.</note> is he; who from baſe Stock and Linage, by his Wealth, is gotten to be within the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And I call him Uncircumciſed, becauſe he hath not cut off the Fore-skin of his Offences; and ſo by his Vertue, wiped away the blot or ſtain of Baſeneſs in his Birth and Linage.</p>
               <p>The Adultering Juſtice is he, that is a Gentleman-Born, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, Diſcreet, and Wiſe; yet Poor and Needy. And ſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his Vertues and Qualities, put into the Commiſſion. This Man, I hold unfit to be a Juſtice, though I think him to be a good Member in the <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi> Becauſe, I hold this for a ground Infallible, That no poor Man ought to be in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; my Reaſon is this, he will ſo Bribe you, and Extert you; that the ſweet Scent of Riches and Gain, takes away and confoundeth the true Taſte of Juſtice and Equity. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>Munera excacant ocules Juſtorum;</hi> and Juſtice is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Impriſoned and Suppreſſed, but by Bribery. And ſuch kind of Miniſters I ſpeak of. And I call him an Adulterating Juſtice becauſe, look how many Bribes he taketh, ſo many Baſtards he begets to the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then let us ſee, whence theſe Juſtices do come, and how they be made. It cannot be denied, but all Juſtices are made by the <hi>Lord-Keeper;</hi> then he is in fault, and none elſe. For my own Opinion, I have ever held him to be a Man both Honourable, Grave, and Wiſe; ſo Juſt, that never was the meaneſt Subject ſo Wronged that he ever Complained.</p>
               <p>Therefore, his Juſtice cannot be Taxed. I, but his Care may, for he only maketh them. No, I may more eaſily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, than our ſelves; for he maketh none, but ſuch as have Certificates Commendatory from the Juſtices of Aſſize. Why then they be in fault; for impoſſible it is, my <hi>Lord-Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> ſhould know the Quality and Sufficiency of them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but only <hi>Per aluim,</hi> in truſt, as by the Juſtices of Aſſize. No, the Gall lies not there; for they neither (by Reaſon they are not always rideing one <hi>Circuit</hi>) are well acquainted with the natures of thoſe ſecret Juſtices; but when any deſireth to be a Juſtice, he getteth a Certificate from divers Juſtices of the Peace in the Country, to the Juſtices of Aſſize, Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying them, of their Sufficiency and Ability. And they again make their Certificate (believing the former) to the <hi>Lord-Keeper,</hi> who at the next Aſſizes, puts them into Commiſſion.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:107812:158"/>And thus is the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> abuſed, and the Juſtices of Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes abuſed, and the Country Troubled with a Corrupt Juſtice, put in Authority.</p>
               <p>The Cauſe comes only from the Juſtices themſelves. And who be they? Even all of you here preſent, or moſt of us. My Suit, therefore is, That you will abſtain from ſuch Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and hold your Hands from Writing Iniquity, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo Sinful a Deed, as to Commend an unworthy Perſon, and not to Commend a Worthy, and Deſerving Subject. And I think this a poſition both true and publique, that it is as great a Sin to add to the Unworthy, as to detract from the Worthy. And Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> if theſe Men may be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Bill; I will not only be ready to go, but to run forth to have ſo good a Law Eſtabliſhed.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Townſhend</hi> (the Collector of this Journal) ſtood up and ſhewed, <hi>That in too much Generality, there never wanted Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. And ſo in this Bill, being too General, namely, all from the Age of</hi> Eighteen <hi>to</hi> Sixty <hi>muſt appear at Muſters, and may be Preſt; no exception of any, and therefore no Profeſſion exempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not unknown unto you, that by Profeſſion, I am a Lawyer, and therefore, unfit to be a Profeſſor of the Art of</hi> War. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I pray, that it would pleaſe the Houſe, if they would Commit the Bill; to Commit it to be returned on the laſt Day of the next Parliament; or elſe, that, as a Worthy Gentleman</hi> (Serjeant Heale) <hi>the laſt Parliament in a Bill of this nature, moved, to have an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or Proviſo, for all Serjeants;</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Motion made in <hi>Mirth.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>it would pleaſe you to admit of a Proviſo for all Lawyers.</hi> At which the Houſe Laughed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, it being done for Mirth. And divers Motions of the like nature, were made.</p>
            <q>
               <p>On <hi>Thurſday Decemb.</hi> 17. Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> ſhewed, The Parliament was now in the Wane; and Order had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Touching the Information delivered to this Houſe in Mr. <hi>Bellgraves</hi> Caſe, but nothing done therein. And (as it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by not taking out of the Proceſs) a Proſecution of the Cauſe is intended, againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Bellgrave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think it therefore fit, becauſe the chief ſcope of the ſaid Information ſeemeth to be Touching a Diſhonor offered to this Houſe, that it would pleaſe you, that it might be put to the Queſtion, Whether he hath Offended this Houſe, yea, or no? If he hath, he deſireth to be Cenſured by you. If he hath not, it will be a good Motive to the Honourable here preſent, who are Judges of that Court, for their Satisfaction, in cleering the Gentleman of that Offence, when it comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> moved the Houſe; <hi>That becauſe the Parliament was like to end on</hi> Saturday, <hi>it would pleaſe them to ſend the Bill of Ordnance to the Lords. And that they might be moved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all private Bills in their Hands, until the</hi> Ten Pounds <hi>or</hi> Five Pounds <hi>was paid, according to our former Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="330" facs="tcp:107812:159"/>
            <p>So the Houſe cried, Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> who went, and did accordingly. And then they proceeded in the Motion, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Bellgrave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Comptroller</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">I know the Gentleman to be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Gentleman, and a good Servant to his Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: And for his Offence to this Houſe, I think it very fit to clear him: And do wiſh it may be put to the Queſtion. If it pleaſe you he may be cleared; I will be ready to vouch your Sentence for his Offence to this Houſe, when it comes there. But, if any other Matter appears upon opening the Cauſe, with That we have not to do withal.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid: Touching this great Offence in the Country; I have heard it ſpoken of diverſly: but for my own part, I am rather apt to move Conſideration againſt him, that drew the Bill (one Mr. <hi>Diott</hi>) and that he ſhould be well Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, who being a Member of this Houſe, ſhould ſeek to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Prerogative of this High Court of Parliament, by praying Aid of the <hi>Star</hi>-Chamber, for an Offence done to Us, this Court Sitting. And I deſire that two things may be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Gentleman (Mr. <hi>Diott</hi>) make an Apology for his Action in drawing of the Information.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Gentleman Mr. <hi>Bellgrave,</hi> may be cleared here; which will be a good inducement to the Lords, not to cenſure him heavily there.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Ravenſcroſt</hi> ſaid: <q rend="inline">The Gentleman (Mr. <hi>Diott</hi>) is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Reputation of an honeſt Man. And we ought not to proceed againſt a Fellow-Member, till he be called. It is not Apparent unto Us, that he made it; the Information is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mr. <hi>Attornies</hi> Hand, and therefore, ought to be intended his; for now it is of Record under his Hand, againſt which we can receive no Averment of Speech of others, other than the Gentlemans own words <hi>viva vocae.</hi> And that I think he will not confeſs. And ſo there was no more ſaid of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was put to the Queſtion, Whether he ſhould be cleared of the Offence to the Houſe; Yea, or No? And all cried, <hi>I, I, I,</hi> but only Young Mr. <hi>Francis Grantham,</hi> who gave a great <hi>No:</hi> At whom the Houſe Laughed, and he Bluſhed.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Sir. <hi>Francis Haſtings</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Fr.

               <p>Divers Speeches have been uſed concerning Juſtices of the Peace, ſo Slanderous and Defamatory; with ſo unwonted Epethites, with ſuch Slanderous Definitions; a Teſtimony of Levity for the one, and ſcant ſound Judgment for the other.</p>

               <p>And therefore, I do humbly pray the Honourable here preſent, that thoſe Juſtices which ſerves Religiouſly, Duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and Carefully, may be Countenanced.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> are two Twins, which Laugh and Live together. Long have we joyed in Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Happy Government, and long may we.</p>

               <p>For my part, I am, and will be ready to lay my Life at Her Feet, to do Her Service; We had need to have ſpecial Care of them, for themſelves do brag they have <hi>Forty Thouſand</hi> true Hearted <hi>Catholiques</hi> (for ſo they call them) in <hi>England;</hi> beſides, their retinue, poor <hi>Catholiques</hi> and <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and I know not what.

               <p>I conclude only with this deſire, that thoſe who have Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, will look that thoſe who have inferior Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may do faithfully: And that we may be kept in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

            <p>On <hi>Saturday, Decemb.</hi> 19. about nine of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, this day being appointed to be the laſt day of the Parliament, and her Majeſty appointed to come to the Houſe, as the Houſe ſat quietly one talking with another, about a hundred being in the Houſe,</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>Mr. Speaker, becauſe I ſee our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is at an end, and that now we have little to do but only to attend her Majeſties pleaſure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Caſe put by Mr. <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> diſcuſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>I will be bold to put a Caſe to the Houſe upon one of our new Statutes of Rogues, offering the Reſolution thereof to your conſiderations, the Caſe being common, and ſit by every man here to be underſtood. It is thus: A woman is begotten with Childe in one houſe, and before ſhe appears to be with Childe, ſhe goeth away and ſerveth in another houſe in another County. My Queſtion is, Where this woman ſhall be relieved, and where this childe ſhall live?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> of the Court, ſaid, <hi>In my opinion, the woman is to be relieved, and the childe alſo, where it is gotten: for their Maſters may look better to them, than let their ſervants be ſo lewd: And therefore this coming by his negligence, or want of care, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by his too much familiarity with his ſervants, I ſee no reaſon but he in whoſe houſe the childe is gotten, ſhould be charged with both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Moore</hi> ſaid, <hi>Partus ſequitur ventrem; the Child follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Mother; and therefore where the Statute alloweth help to the Mother, there is relief alſo to be given unto the Childe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Phetyplace</hi> ſaid, <hi>I know not how it is in the Country, or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places; but in the City I am ſure, the man of the houſe is ever the reputed Father, till the true Father be known, or confeſſed by the Mother. If the Father be known, and able to keep the Childe, then by the Law he is conſtrained to relieve the woman and the Childe; if he be not able, the uſe with us in</hi> London <hi>is, That the Childe ſhall be delivered to ſome Hoſpital, or to the Pariſh, there to be relieved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſaid, <hi>I think I am not to be debarred from ſpeech, for this is not</hi> More Parliamentario, <hi>but that I may deliver my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And I ſhall rather hold, ſhe is to be relieved by neither, but that it ſhould be accompted for her own ſin and her own impiety; and the example of Penury (in no relief) is better than any Admonition.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:107812:161"/>And if ſome ſtraight and ſevere courſe be not uſed, the ſin is ſo common, that in ſhort time we ſhall have nothing more common, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when we do uſe ſuch cockering of them as we now do, and count it a matter of charity to relieve them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Francis Moore</hi> thought, that both in charity and by law, they both ought to be relieved, by the expreſs words of the Statutes.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker moved the Houſe to know their pleaſures, whether they would adjourn the Houſe till one of the clock; and as they were riſing,</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Herbert Crofts</hi> ſaid, <hi>Mr. Speaker, though my Motion perhaps may ſeem unſeaſonable, yet I beſeech the Houſe to conſider with me, a Speech that conſiſted yeſterday of four parts</hi> (<hi>it being Mr.</hi> Hack-well<hi>'s Speech) laying open the dangerous miſchiefs that come by tranſportation of Ordnance; and that due reformation thereof may be had for reſtraint of private tranſporting. I would onely put the Houſe in mind, and you alſo, Mr. Speaker, that the Gentlemen which yeſterday moved it, deſired that Mr. Speaker might ſay ſomething thereof to her Majeſty in his Speech to be inſerted; which I do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain deſire the more earneſtly, becauſe our Bill is fallen, as he ſaid, into an everlaſting ſleep, and we have no remedy but by her Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> ſaid, <hi>If it pleaſe you, I mean upon the Motion the Gentlemen made yeſterday, to ſay ſomething therein both for your ſatisfaction and performance of my duty; and therefore this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall need no further to be moved.</hi> With which the Houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted well ſatisfied, and ſo roſe.</p>
            <p>But it is to be noted, That the Speaker ſaid not one word in his Speech to her Majeſty touching the matter; which was greatly murmured at, and ſpoken againſt amongſt the Burgeſſes, that the Houſe ſhould be ſo abuſed; but nothing was done therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Afternoon,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About one of the clock, divers Gentlemen met together in the Houſe, whither the Speaker came, and after the Privy-Counſellors; where, after ſitting ſome half an hour at paſt two, they went up to the Upper Houſe, and ſtaid there at the Gallery-door about half an hour; and at length the door was opened: And the Lords of the Upper Houſe being all ſat, and her Majeſty under a rich Cloath of Eſtate,<note place="margin">The Q. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the Speaker went to the uſual place at the bar; where, after three Reverences made, and the like done in their times by all the Commons, the Speaker ſaid to this effect.</p>
            <p>THat Laws were not firſt made with humane Pen,<note place="margin">The Speakers Speech.</note> but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinance; that Politick Laws were made according to the evil conditions of men; and that all Laws ſerved not for all times, no more than one Medicine for all Diſeaſes: If he were aſked what was the firſt and chiefeſt thing to be conſidered of, he would have ſaid, Religion: If, what is the ſecond? Religion: If what is the third? Religion. So Religion is all in all; for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on breeds Devotion, Devotion breeds Zeal and Piety to God,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:107812:161"/>which breedeth Obedience and Duty to the Prince; and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Laws, which breeds Faithfulneſs, Honeſty, and Love, three neceſſary and onely things to be wiſhed and obſerved in a well-govern'd Commonwealth. And that her Majeſty, by plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting true Religion, had laid ſuch a foundation, upon which all theſe three Vertues were ſo planted and builded, that they could not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be rooted up and extirpated: and therefore we did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we ought and do acknowledge, we will praiſe God and her Majeſty for it.</p>
            <p>And then he deſcended to ſpeak of Governments and Laws of Nations; amongſt and above all which, he principally preferr'd the Laws of this Realm; which, he ſaid, were ſo many and ſo wiſe, that there was almoſt no offence, but it was met with in a Law.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding her Majeſty being deſirous, for the good of her Realm, to call a Parliament for redreſs of ſome Laws, and for making ſome new; Her dutiful and loving Subjects, having conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of them, have made ſome new, and amended ſome old; which they moſt humbly deſire may be made Laws by her moſt Royal Aſſent, which giveth life unto them.</p>
            <p>And ſo, after thanks given for the Pardon, by which we dread your Juſtice and admire your Mercy, and a Prayer, That ſhe would accept, as a teſtimony of our Loves and Duties offered unto her with a free heart and willing ſpirit, four entire Subſidies, and eight Fifteenths and Tenths, to be collected of our Lands and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods; (in ſpeaking whereof, he miſtook, and ſaid, Four entire Fifteenths and eight Subſidies; but he was remembred by ſome of the Counſel that ſtood neer about him, and ſo ſpake right as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid:) And alſo pardon craved for his offences, if either he had forgotten himſelf in words or action, he ended.</p>
            <p>To which, the Lord Keeper anſwered thus in effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> AS touching her Majeſties proceeding in the Laws for her Royal Aſſent,<note place="margin">The L. Keepers Speech in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> that ſhould be as God ſhould direct her ſacred ſpirit. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For your preſentation of four entire Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies, and eight Fifteens and Tenths; And <hi>thirdly,</hi> Your humble thank-fulneſs for the pardon for them and your ſelf; I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver her Majeſties Commandment with what brevity I may, that I be not tedious to my most gracious Soveraign.</p>
            <q>
               <p>First, She ſaith touching your proceeding in the matter of her Prerogative, that ſhe is perſwaded Subjects did never more dutifully; and that ſhe underſtood you did but <hi>obiter</hi> touch her Prerogative, and not otherwiſe but by humble Petition: and therefore that thanks that a Prince may give to her Subjects, ſhe willingly yieldeth. But ſhe now well perceiveth that private reſpects are privately masked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der publick pretences.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Touching the preſentation of your Subſidies, ſhe ſpecially regardeth two things, both the perſons, and the manner: For the first, he fell into commendations of the Commonalty; for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the manner, which was ſpeedy, not by perſwaſion, or perſwaſive inducements, but freely, and of duty, with great contentment. In
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107812:162"/>the thing which we have granted, her Majeſty greatly commendeth your confidence and judgments; and though it be not proportionable to her occaſions, yet ſhe moſt thank fully receiveth the ſame, as a loving and thank-ful Prince. And ſaid that no Prince was ever more unwilling to exact or receive any thing from the Subject than ſhe our moſt gracious Soveraign; for we all know ſhe never was a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Graſper, nor ſtraight-handed keeper: And therefore ſhe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to ſay, That you had done (and ſo ſhe taketh it) duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, plentifully, and thank-fully.</p>
               <p>For your ſelf, Mr. Speaker, her Majeſty commanded me to ſay, That you have proceeded with ſuch wiſdom and diſcretion, that it is much to your commendation, and that none before had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more. <hi>And ſo he ended, after an Admonition given to the Juſtices of Peace, That they would not deſerve the Epethites of prowling Juſtices, Juſtices of Quarrels, who counted Champerty good Cheveſance; ſuing Juſtices, who did ſuck and conſume the Wealth and Good of the Commonwealth; and alſo to thoſe who do lie, if not all the year, yet at leaſt three quarters of the year, at</hi> London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After this Speech ended, the Clerk of the Crown read the Titles of ſeveral Acts. To the general Acts which were allowed, the Clerk of the Parliament anſwered,</hi> Le Roygne le veult: <hi>To the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Acts to be paſſed,</hi> Soit come il est deſiré: <hi>To the general Acts not paſſed,</hi> Le Roygne s'adviſerá: <hi>And ſo to the other. To the Subſidies and Pardon, as in the laſt Parliament. Which done,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord Keeper ſaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Parl. diſſolved.</note> It is her Majeſties pleaſure, that this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhall be diſſolved; and ſhe giveth licenſe to all Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, to depart at their pleaſure: And ſo</p>

                     <p>I ſcarce know how to enter into this matter, and I am ſorry that now in ſpeaking I ſhall lay open the looſeneſs of the times: neither are her Majeſties Proclamations regarded, neither her Councils Letters reſpected, neither her late-made Statutes and Decrees obeyed, nor put in ſo due execution as they ought.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things deſerve to have a more round and ſtrict courſe than have been uſed; and we deſerve not ſo gracious a Pardon as it hath pleaſed her moſt gracious Majeſty, out of her meer good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, lately to beſtow upon us: but this onely to divers perſons and offences, of thoſe which live in degree of private men.</p>

The time of Lent and abſtinence from Fleſh, if it be not duely obſerved, what Dearth and Penury will not almoſt enſue? And therefore was the time of Lent well placed, even in the Spring, and the beginning of the increaſe of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:107812:171"/>Beaſts. Her Majeſties expreſs command is, That it be ſtrictly obſerved, and that with this caution, That where fault ſhall be found, that there extremity ſhall be inflicted, and that no tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch offences ſhall be ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>Next, That ye inquire what Places and perſons are fit to be ſuppreſſed and looked unto; Ordinary-tables, Tippling-houſes, ſome even Brothel-houſes or worſe, in which both of Muttons, Veals, and Lambs, there is continually made an unmeaſurable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
                     <p>But conſider who are the men that devour the Subſtance of the Land, which ſhould ſuſtain us all; what kind of men be they? even your diſcourſers, which do introduce Novelties, and ſlander the State; the moſt peſtilent, ſeditious, and dangerous Members of the Land. In rooting out theſe men, you ſhall ſhew the beſt part of your duties to God and her Majeſty; which her Majeſty expreſsly chargeth you to take ſpecial heed of.</p>
                     <p>I am alſo to remember you what good Laws were lately made for the puniſhment of vagrant Rogues and ſturdy Beggars,<note place="margin">To relieve poor Souldiers.</note> and for the proviſion of poor Souldiers; the neglect of which duty, in not ſeeing theſe good Laws executed, will draw Gods curſe and diſpleaſure upon us: And therefore order by you ought to be taken, that thoſe which be poor be relieved, and idle perſons ſuppreſſed, which do miſpend the good gifts of God plentifully beſtowed upon us: That you look the poverty of Souldiers be relieved according to their quality and degree, and that twenty pounds by the year be not given to ſome, when others, far poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, have but forty ſhillings by the year: And therefore look that thoſe Laws that were laſt made be not laſt, but firſt put in execution. Theſe be matters and crimes, which if they be not amended, the Commonwealth and State may ſtill ſtand, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, though not periſh.</p>
                     <p>But there is another matter of great importance, which if it be not looked unto, will overthrow even the body of the State it ſelf; which none can or will deny, unleſs he be given over to a ſenſeleſs ſtupidity. It is not unknown what Plots have been and are laid againſt the Queens Perſon (whom God preſerve) and the body of the State, by thoſe we call Jeſuits, unnatural Vipers ready to eat out the belly of their Mother; who being now grown to ſome ſtrength and head, do proceed with more violence and greater malice in their actions, than ever hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>They have made unto them an Archprieſt and Ruler,<note place="margin">About Jeſuits and ſecular Prieſts, their practices.</note> the principal Agent againſt God, the Queen, Religion, and the State, becauſe they might execute their dangerous Enterprizes and Deſignes with a kind of conjoyned Unity. They do not ſtick to determine even in the height of their pride, great, yea even the greateſt matters. In this the Secular Prieſt is no Agent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dangerous in that degree to the State: for as there be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Offences, ſo are there degrees of Offenders. But I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe not the Secular Prieſt, and therefore therein I pray you miſtake me not; for what Writings and Books have been extant
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:107812:171"/>and are given out, of their Quarrels and Controverſies! and I warn you to take heed of them.</p>
                     <p>There be three Workers in the ſubverſion of the State: Firſt, the Jeſuit; ſecondly, the ſecular Prieſt; and thirdly, a kinde of Parſon of our own Religion, yet as he thinketh of a more pure ſpirit, diſliking onely the government of the Church and State. Theſe her Majeſties pleaſure is, That you ſhould be more diligent to ſearch out than you have been, and to obſerve who entertains theſe in their houſes which be of the Catholick Roman Religion.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that incur the danger of the Law, let them now look for execution, howſoever offences heretofore have been tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Magiſtrates not doing of their duties. Many are Juſtices of the Peace, but what do they but maintain Quarrels, Stirs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and Diſſention betwixt their Neighbours? We have two evident Examples; the one in <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> the other that was moved this morning, <hi>viz.</hi> in Sir <hi>Thomas Throgmorton</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
                     <p>The thirſt after this Authority,<note place="margin">Concerning Juſtices of the Peace.</note> proceedeth from nothing but an ambitious humour of gaining of Reputation amongſt their Neighbours, that ſtill when they come home, they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with Preſents, and that they may ſit high on the Bench in the Quarter-Seſſions, that they may maintain and buy Titles. Is there any more fervent than others in the buſineſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth? he ſtraight hath given him the Epethite of a buſie Jack: but I know there be many good, and I wiſh their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were increaſed; but who be they? even the poorer and meaneſt Juſtices, by one of which more good cometh to the Commonwealth, than by a hundred of greater condition and degree. And thus much I had in commandment to ſay to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Peace, to Commanders, to Conſtables, and other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officers.</p>
                     <p>To you who be Juſtices of Aſſize, there yet remaineth, by her Majeſties expreſs commandment, a further Charge and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to be delivered: That you ſee the great offences, which heretofore have not been, to be hereafter puniſhed. And her Majeſty ſaid, ſhe hath choſen you to be Juſtices for your wiſdom and integrity; and ſhe hath divided you by two's in ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, to ride twice every year, that the one might be aiding and aſſiſting to the other, not onely to try a <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> or decide ſome petty Cauſe, but with ſpecial care and diligent obſervance, to look into the diſorders of your Circuits, ſuppoſe for the purpoſe in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> although truely I think that County is beſt govern'd; and I would ſay more, if he which rideth that Circuit were abſent.</p>
                     <p>To examine Juſtices touching Miſdemeanours, to inform her Majeſty how many Ale-houſes they have pulled down, how many Prieſts they have taken, and who harbour them; and of all theſe matters to give an account to her Majeſty at your return, that ſhe taking notice from you, the good Juſtices may be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the evil removed.</p>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:107812:172"/>
                     <p>Your not doing of this, breedeth nothing but impunity, which is dangerous in the State, and the very root of Sedition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: And Clemency of this nature, is <hi>Crudelis Clementia,</hi> but the other <hi>Securitas Salutaris.</hi> Her Majeſty commanded me to ſay unto you, that ſhe would have you ſpend more time in underſtanding the faults and grievances in every of your Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, than you have heretofore done; for ſhe ſaith, that ſhe hath not been informed of any more than of one onely.</p>
                     <p>This you may well do, and ſhe commandeth it to be done, the times being ſo peaceful, which I hope will continue. And as God hath bleſſed her Majeſty theſe Forty four years amongſt us, ſo I hope God will yet lengthen her days: for the continuance of which, we ought all to pray for.</p>
